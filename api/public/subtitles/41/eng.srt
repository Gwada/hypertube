1
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,965
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.</i>

2
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:36,283
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

3
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,325
<i>The engines are dead. Life support failing.</i>

4
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:43,572
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range.</i>

5
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,999
<i>We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.</i>

6
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,059
<i>Our crew is made up of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,065
<i>This is not a warcraft, I
repeat, this is not a warcraft.</i>

8
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:12,362
Hear me... and rejoice.

9
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,156
You have had the privilege

10
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,238
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

11
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,490
You may think this is suffering.

12
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,898
No.

13
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:31,654
It is salvation.

14
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,768
The universal scales

15
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:41,558
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

16
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:44,403
Smile.

17
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,250
For even in death

18
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,490
you have become
Children of Thanos.

19
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,414
I know what it's like to lose.

20
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:13,371
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

21
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,022
yet to fail nonetheless.

22
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,159
As lightning

23
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,380
turns the legs to jelly.

24
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,516
I ask you
to what end?

25
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,356
Dread it, run from it...

26
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,183
Destiny arrives all the same.

27
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,215
And now, it's here.

28
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,493
Or should I say...

29
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,527
I am.

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,867
You talk too much.

31
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,041
The Tesseract.

32
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,731
Or, your brother's head.

33
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:08,393
I assume you have a preference?

34
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,160
Oh, I do.

35
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:14,921
Kill away.

36
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,432
All right, stop!

37
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:38,767
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

38
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,961
You really are the worst, brother.

39
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:01,501
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

40
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:06,389
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

41
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:10,704
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

42
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:12,218
And for another...

43
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,753
we have the Hulk.

44
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,545
Let him have his fun.

45
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,245
Forefathers...

46
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,676
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

47
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,752
That was a mistake.

48
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,449
No!

49
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,051
You are going to die for that!

50
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:19,383
My humble personage...

51
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:24,028
bows before your grandeur.

52
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,972
No other being has
ever had the might,

53
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,043
nay, the nobility,

54
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,689
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

55
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:41,286
The Universe,

56
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:44,605
lies within your grasp.

57
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,001
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

58
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:31,300
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

59
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:35,531
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

60
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,018
If you're going to Earth,

61
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:39,645
you might want a guide.

62
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:42,368
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

63
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,855
If you consider failure experience.

64
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,560
I consider experience, experience.

65
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,531
Almighty Thanos.

66
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:55,803
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

67
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,402
Odin-son...

68
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,658
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

69
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,449
God of Mischief...

70
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,749
Do hereby pledge to you,

71
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,314
my undying fidelity.

72
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,107
"Undying"?

73
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:35,480
You should choose your
words more carefully.

74
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,400
You...

75
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:01,098
will never be...

76
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,226
a god.

77
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,242
No resurrections this time.

78
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,825
No... Loki...

79
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:40,298
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

80
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,630
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

81
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,015
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

82
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,619
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical ham on rye.

83
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:50,158
- Wait, wait. I think I have 200.
- Dollars?

84
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,131
- Rupees.
- Which is?

85
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:55,461
- Uh, a buck and a half.
- What do you want?

86
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,006
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

87
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,972
Thanos is coming.

88
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:14,153
He's coming.

89
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:19,375
Who?

90
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,394
- Slow down and I'll spell it out for you.
- You're totally rambling.

91
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,686
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

92
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,557
- Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee? - Yeah.

93
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,092
Okay, and then you're like, Oh my God,
there's no bathrooms, what am I gonna do?

94
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:39,248
- Right. - Oh, Someone's watching!
I'm gonna go in my pants, and...

95
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:42,246
And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

96
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,612
- Yes.
- Yeah.

97
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,697
Everybody has that.

98
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,104
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

99
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,951
Apropos of that. Last night,
I dreamt, we had a kid.

100
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,571
It was so real.

101
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,642
We named him after
your eccentric uncle, uh,

102
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:57,645
- What was his name? - Right.
- Morgan. Morgan.

103
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,557
- So you woke up, and...
- Naturally. - ...thought that we were...

104
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:02,833
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

105
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:03,749
- Yes?
- No.

106
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:07,231
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

107
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,301
You wouldn't have done that.

108
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,532
I'm glad you brought this up

109
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,244
cause it's nothing, it's
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

110
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,969
- You're just not helping your case. OK?
- It's just an attachment. It's not a...

111
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,581
- You don't need that.
- I know, I had the surgery.

112
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,657
I'm just trying to protect us, and
the future us-es, and that's it.

113
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:24,372
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Instead of, you know...

114
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,991
Shirts.

115
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,813
You know me so well.

116
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,069
You finish all my sentences.

117
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:34,194
You should have shirts
in your closet.

118
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,995
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

119
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,637
No more surprises. We're gonna
have a nice dinner tonight.

120
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,041
Show off this Harry Win-stone.
Right?

121
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,224
And we should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

122
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,907
- Yeah.
- I will.

123
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:49,589
I think you...

124
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,791
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

125
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,376
I need you to come with me.

126
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,144
Oh, uh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

127
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,229
I'm sorry, are you giving
out tickets or something?

128
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,557
We need your help.

129
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:06,605
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

130
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:09,162
And who's "we"?

131
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:12,334
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

132
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,643
- Pepper.
- Hi.

133
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,984
You okay?

134
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,130
At the dawn of the Universe,

135
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,990
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

136
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:30,064
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

137
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:33,220
hurtling across the virgin Universe.

138
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,618
These Infinity Stones

139
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,614
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

140
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,118
Space.

141
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,659
Reality.

142
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:46,286
Power.

143
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,491
Soul.

144
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,112
Mind.

145
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,521
And Time.

146
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,038
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

147
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,495
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

148
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,405
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

149
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,838
The attack on New York. That's him.

150
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,184
This is it.

151
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,847
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

152
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:23,524
He has the Power and Space Stones,

153
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:26,203
that already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

154
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:29,130
If he gets his hands on
all six Stones, Tony...

155
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:33,039
He could destroy life on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

156
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,917
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

157
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,277
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

158
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,389
Is that what that is?

159
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,341
I'm going to allow that.

160
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,567
If Thanos needs all six,

161
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,702
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

162
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:49,838
No can do.

163
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,918
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

164
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:56,296
And I swore off dairy, but then Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

165
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:58,086
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

166
00:14:58,111 --> 00:14:59,364
A bit chalky.

167
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,364
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

168
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:04,054
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

169
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,738
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

170
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,955
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

171
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,017
Yeah, so, conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

172
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,689
Only if we don't do our jobs.

173
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,842
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

174
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,973
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

175
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:23,141
Okay guys, can we, can we table
this discussion right now?

176
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,543
The fact is, is that we have this stone.
We know where it is.

177
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,031
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

178
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:31,065
And we have to find him now.

179
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,161
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

180
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:37,625
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

181
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,815
What?

182
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,614
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

183
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,540
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

184
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,372
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

185
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:55,172
Maybe. But...

186
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,342
Call him.

187
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,304
It's not that easy.

188
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:05,224
- God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?  - No.

189
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,241
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

190
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:09,984
Broke up?

191
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,755
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

192
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,586
We're not on speaking terms.

193
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,886
Tony, listen to me.

194
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:24,920
Thor's gone.

195
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:29,480
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

196
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,467
It's...

197
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:11,235
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

198
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,753
Not at the moment, no.

199
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,380
You okay?

200
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,878
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

201
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,913
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

202
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:58,362
Hey! You better not have put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

203
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,286
I might wanna use it.

204
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,535
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

205
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,856
Holy shit!

206
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:35,391
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

207
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,304
What's the matter with you kids?

208
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,855
You never seen a spaceship before?

209
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:03,372
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street. Notify first responders.

210
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:04,554
Will do.

211
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:36,076
Hear me, and rejoice!

212
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:41,238
- You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos. - Us.

213
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:46,164
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to the balance...

214
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,214
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

215
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,064
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

216
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,577
Stone keeper...

217
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,293
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

218
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,251
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

219
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,783
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

220
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:05,205
- That means get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

221
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:08,382
- ([I can tell.])
- Bring me the Stone.
- ([Yes I will.])

222
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,675
Banner, you want a piece?

223
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,660
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

224
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,069
That's right.

225
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:20,684
Been a while. It's gonna be
good to have you, buddy.

226
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,539
Shh. I just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

227
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:26,524
Come on, come on, (Max).

228
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,408
Where's your guy?

229
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:33,653
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

230
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:37,307
- There's no time for a thing. - I know.
- That's the thing right there. Let's go.

231
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,113
- Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards. - I'm sorry.

232
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,616
- I can't...or he won't...I don't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

233
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,885
- Keep an eye on him? Thank you.
- I have him.

234
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,980
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech, you like it? A little something I...

235
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,328
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

236
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:42,697
- You gotta get that Stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

237
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:44,356
Exactly. Bye!

238
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:56,135
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

239
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,343
Really, really good.  Really good.|Do you plan on helping out?

240
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,358
I'm trying. He won't come out.

241
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:02,009
Hang on!

242
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,909
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing to me?

243
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,357
Come out. Come out! Come out!

244
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,827
No!

245
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:24,311
What do you mean, "no"?

246
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,202
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

247
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,423
The field trip.  (Yer Moma!)

248
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:38,116
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

249
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,746
Uh, he's from space. He came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

250
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,598
Oh, yeah?

251
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:12,622
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

252
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,132
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

253
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,357
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

254
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:37,191
You'll find...removing...a dead
man's spell...is troublesome.

255
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,591
You'll only wish you were dead.

256
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,643
No!

257
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,617
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

258
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:06,329
Not cool.

259
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:11,277
Gotcha!

260
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:13,503
Hey!

261
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,173
- Uh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

262
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,147
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

263
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,917
Give me a little juice, Friday.

264
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:07,022
Unlock 17-A.

265
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,894
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

266
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:23,748
But you said save the wizard!

267
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:25,570
I can't breathe!

268
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:28,338
We're too high up. You're
running out of air.

269
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,763
That makes sense.

270
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:50,165
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

271
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,466
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

272
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:55,085
Oh, come on!

273
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,315
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

274
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:07,843
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

275
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,877
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

276
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:11,997
Why?

277
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,358
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

278
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:18,166
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

279
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:20,518
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

280
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,951
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

281
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,416
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

282
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,346
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

283
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:27,636
Come back!

284
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:32,188
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

285
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,972
Oh, my God.

286
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:49,190
I should have stayed on the bus.

287
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,122
- Where you going?
- The Time Stone's been taken.

288
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,439
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

289
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,939
What will you do?

290
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:13,556
I'm gonna make a call.

291
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,236
Got his feet to movin'

292
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:40,106
and that rubberband off the ground

293
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,998
He lifted it way up high, ha

294
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:44,645
In the sky, 'y'all

295
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:45,910
And then he

296
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:47,842
Oh get with it, y’all

297
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:51,808
Hey, y’all prepare yourself
for The Rubberband...yeaaah

298
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,762
Sing it, Drax!

299
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:02,320
You’re bound to lose control when
The Rubberband starts to jam

300
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,142
Why are we doing this again?

301
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,864
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

302
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,876
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

303
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,827
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

304
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,446
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

305
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,608
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

306
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:27,586
- Exactly!
- B-b-b-bingo!
- Alright!

307
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,769
We are arriving.

308
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,263
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

309
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:36,703
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

310
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,307
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

311
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,988
I am Groot!

312
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:49,295
- Whoa! Language!
- Hey! - Wow!

313
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,141
You got some acorns on you, kid.

314
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:54,654
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

315
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:58,392
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

316
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:07,847
What happened?

317
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:12,895
Oh, my God.

318
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,355
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

319
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:25,414
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

320
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:34,802
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

321
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:38,454
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

322
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:42,075
This... This is a man.

323
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:45,774
- A handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

324
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:48,777
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

325
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:52,858
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have a little weight...

326
00:29:54,478 --> 00:29:56,823
Gamora, do you think I'm...

327
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:01,932
He is anxious. Angry.

328
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,083
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

329
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:09,268
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

330
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:12,062
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

331
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:13,333
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

332
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:16,044
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

333
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,702
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

334
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:21,594
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

335
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,622
Stop massaging his muscles.

336
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,748
Wake him up.

337
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:29,982
Wake.

338
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:50,044
Who the hell are you guys?

339
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:56,183
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

340
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:59,991
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

341
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:05,075
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

342
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,161
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

343
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,109
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

344
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:15,472
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

345
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:18,926
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

346
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:25,503
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

347
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:30,173
Stepfather, technically.  She
hates him as much as you do.

348
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,132
Families can be tough.

349
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:38,057
Well, before my father died,
he told me that I had a half-sister...

350
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:41,212
that he imprisoned in Hel.
Then she returned

351
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:44,877
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

352
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,882
There's life, there was nothingness.

353
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,667
Round and round and...

354
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:52,840
- I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

355
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:55,423
Because, I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

356
00:31:55,448 --> 00:32:00,484
My father killed my mother, and then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

357
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,451
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

358
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,713
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

359
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,489
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

360
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:11,434
How do I open this thing?

361
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,520
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

362
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,570
- Like a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

363
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:19,819
Taking your pod.

364
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:23,523
Ahem.  No, you're not!

365
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:29,203
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

366
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:32,853
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

367
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:35,805
- No.
- You are.

368
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,777
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

369
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:41,114
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

370
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:44,096
This is my voice!

371
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:51,389
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

372
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:53,494
Please just stop.
Just don't do it again.

373
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,789
- He's trying to copy me.
- Yeah, just stop doing that.

374
00:32:55,814 --> 00:32:58,875
- Enough! - He's doing it first.
- We need to stop Thanos.

375
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,798
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

376
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,831
Knowhere.

377
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:07,602
- He must be going somewhere.
- No, no. Knowhere? It's a place.

378
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,277
We've been there. It sucks.

379
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:11,137
Excuse me, that's our food.

380
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:13,444
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

381
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:16,024
Why would he go to Knowhere?

382
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:18,899
Because for years, the
Reality Stone has been safely stored

383
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,172
there with a man
called the Collector.

384
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:23,153
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

385
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:24,980
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

386
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,033
Or a genius.

387
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,847
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

388
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,811
There're six stones out there.

389
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:35,674
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

390
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:37,620
when he decimated Xandar.

391
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,948
He stole the Space Stone from me.

392
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:42,911
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

393
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:45,923
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

394
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,271
- The Avengers?
- The Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

395
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:51,276
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

396
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,509
I haven't been there in a while.

397
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:54,802
As for the Soul Stone, well
no one's ever seen that.

398
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,309
No one even knows where it is.

399
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,890
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Knowhere.

400
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:03,316
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

401
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,350
- Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
- Wrong.

402
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,964
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

403
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:14,032
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

404
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:17,119
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

405
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,538
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

406
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:21,715
I would very much like
to go there, please.

407
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,997
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

408
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:25,320
Rabbit?

409
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,855
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

410
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,300
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

411
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:33,546
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

412
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,353
Lemme just ask the captain. Oh wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

413
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,998
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

414
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:41,556
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

415
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,159
- Go sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

416
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,895
And I'm not going to...

417
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:49,304
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

418
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:51,322
The Thanos killing kind.

419
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:53,195
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

420
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,392
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

421
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,955
Your bodies would crumble as your
minds collapsed into madness.

422
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,866
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

423
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:01,002
A little bit. Yeah.

424
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:03,854
If we don't go to Knowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

425
00:35:03,878 --> 00:35:06,426
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

426
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,239
I got it figured out.

427
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:11,760
We got two ships, and a
large assortment of morons.

428
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,086
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

429
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,434
and the morons will go to
Knowhere to try to stop Thanos.

430
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:20,031
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

431
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:21,806
For the record...

432
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,528
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

433
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:28,908
You know, you really shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

434
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:31,120
Come on, Groot.

435
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,780
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

436
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:41,688
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

437
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:57,553
Vis?

438
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,857
Is it the stone again?

439
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,143
It's as if it's speaking to me.

440
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,388
What does it say?

441
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,330
I don't... I don't know.
Something.

442
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:23,071
Tell me what you feel.

443
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,561
I just feel you.

444
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:43,349
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

445
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,695
to give us more time together
before you went back.

446
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,722
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

447
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:51,506
What if I missed all the trains?

448
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:54,501
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

449
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:57,153
- You gave Stark your word.
- I would rather give it to you.

450
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:00,627
Well there are people expecting me too,
you know. We both made promises.

451
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,323
Not to each other.

452
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,607
Wanda...

453
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:08,550
For two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work, and,

454
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:13,140
I don't know, I, but, eh, ah, first...
you know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

455
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:17,662
- I, I... I think...I think...
- It works. - It works. - It works.

456
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:23,609
Stay.
Stay with me.

457
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:32,071
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

458
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:41,118
What are they?

459
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:44,418
What the stone was
warning me about.

460
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:58,200
- I have to go.
- No, Vision. Vision, if that's true...

461
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,313
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

462
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,796
- Wanda, I...
- Vision!

463
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:36,402
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

464
00:38:36,786 --> 00:38:40,189
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

465
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:41,864
My systems are failing.

466
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,682
I'm beginning to think...

467
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,836
We should've stayed in bed.

468
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,120
Vis!

469
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:01,843
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

470
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,574
Hands off.

471
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,625
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

472
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,698
We have to go.

473
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:11,031
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

474
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm staying.

475
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:26,282
- Get up.
- I can't.

476
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,129
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

477
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:32,257
You'll never get
the chance again.

478
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:48,934
Can you stand?

479
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,526
Thank you, Captain.

480
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,241
Let's get you on the jet.

481
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:06,515
I thought
we had a deal.

482
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,533
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

483
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:14,638
Sorry. We just wanted time.

484
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,924
Where to, Cap?

485
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,701
Home.

486
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:28,155
Shh. We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

487
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:55,198
- Zehoberians...
- Mother!

488
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:58,515
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!  Mother!

489
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:04,112
One side is a reservation.
The other, an honor known only to the wheat.

490
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,465
What's wrong, little one?

491
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,462
My mother. Where is my mother?

492
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,502
What's your name?

493
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,021
Gamora.

494
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:23,477
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

495
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:27,778
Come. Let me help you.

496
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,510
Look.

497
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:48,595
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

498
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,738
As all things should be.

499
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:55,719
Too much to one side,
or the other...

500
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:01,947
Here. You try.

501
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,411
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

502
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:15,749
Concentrate.

503
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:21,879
There! You've got it.

504
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:31,777
Gamora.

505
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,250
Do you know if these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

506
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,955
'Cause I was thinking about hanging
a couple on my belt right here.

507
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:42,005
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

508
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:43,937
Yeah, sure.

509
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,789
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

510
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,719
Which is what the
grenades are for.

511
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:55,148
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

512
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:59,255
If things go wrong...

513
00:44:59,545 --> 00:45:02,117
If Thanos gets me...

514
00:45:06,216 --> 00:45:10,713
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

515
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,503
What?

516
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:18,126
I know something he doesn't.

517
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:22,302
If he finds it out...

518
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:25,626
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

519
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,559
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

520
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:34,273
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

521
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,467
Only if you wanna die.

522
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:38,333
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

523
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:39,843
Just...

524
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:44,847
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

525
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,196
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

526
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,557
Swear to me.

527
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,018
Swear to me on your mother.

528
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,747
Okay.

529
00:46:10,246 --> 00:46:12,047
Okay.

530
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:30,973
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

531
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,742
- An hour.
- An hour?

532
00:46:33,797 --> 00:46:35,462
Are you serious?

533
00:46:35,479 --> 00:46:41,288
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

534
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,292
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

535
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:53,758
- You're eating a zarg nut.
- But my movement...

536
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:56,182
So slow...

537
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,523
- That it's imperceptible.
- No.

538
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:03,494
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

539
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,577
Damn it.

540
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,369
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

541
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:34,140
- In the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

542
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:37,856
Let's put down over here.

543
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:55,027
Everyone in the galaxy knows you
would sell your own brother if

544
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:58,632
you thought it would add even the
slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.

545
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,222
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

546
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:14,061
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

547
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:21,078
I told you. I sold it.

548
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:28,254
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

549
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:32,562
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

550
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:35,448
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

551
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,614
I didn't know what it was.

552
00:48:37,622 --> 00:48:40,758
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

553
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:43,823
- That's him.
- Last chance, charlatan.

554
00:48:44,634 --> 00:48:46,636
Where's the Stone?

555
00:48:46,753 --> 00:48:51,742
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

556
00:48:51,774 --> 00:48:53,391
Drax, wait!

557
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,137
Whoa, not yet!
Not yet!

558
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:02,730
Listen to me.

559
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:05,614
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

560
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:07,952
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

561
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:10,839
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

562
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:16,274
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

563
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:18,190
Sleep.

564
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:34,648
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

565
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:37,972
I'm... The other right!

566
00:50:01,273 --> 00:50:03,853
Why?

567
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:17,296
Why you? Daughter...

568
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,980
That was quick.

569
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:45,861
Magnificent! Magnificent!

570
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:47,767
Magnificent!

571
00:50:49,832 --> 00:50:53,477
<i>Is that sadness I sense
in you, daughter?</i>

572
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:59,279
<i>In my heart, I knew
you still cared.</i>

573
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:08,674
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

574
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,649
<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

575
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:27,360
That is, it was.

576
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,941
Now...

577
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:35,248
Reality can be whatever I want.

578
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:39,517
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

579
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:43,775
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

580
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:49,584
Thanos!

581
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:06,257
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

582
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,784
- I told you to go right.
- Now? Really?

583
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:14,320
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

584
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:19,246
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long-term booty call.

585
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,233
- Let her go.
- Peter...

586
00:52:21,257 --> 00:52:25,909
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

587
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,232
Not him.

588
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,356
You promised!

589
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,923
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

590
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,153
She's asked, hasn't she?

591
00:52:59,657 --> 00:53:01,235
Do it.

592
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,813
Do it!

593
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:18,025
I told you to go right!

594
00:53:18,722 --> 00:53:21,896
I love you, more than anything.

595
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:27,449
I love you, too.

596
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:42,379
I like you.

597
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,238
Still no word from Vision?

598
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,929
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

599
00:54:16,945 --> 00:54:20,917
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

600
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:22,140
You know they're only criminals

601
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:24,367
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

602
00:54:24,392 --> 00:54:28,811
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

603
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:32,281
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

604
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:35,793
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

605
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:37,652
That's right.

606
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,055
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

607
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,387
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

608
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:53,315
Mr. Secretary.

609
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:59,713
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

610
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:02,685
You could use some
of that right now.

611
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,719
The world's on fire.

612
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:09,379
And you think, all is forgiven?

613
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:14,243
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking permission.

614
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:20,350
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

615
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:23,275
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

616
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,021
We'll fight you, too.

617
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:32,648
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

618
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:40,022
That's a court-martial.

619
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:45,489
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

620
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:46,844
Hey.

621
00:55:48,587 --> 00:55:53,162
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

622
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,983
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

623
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,135
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

624
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,450
I think you look great.

625
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:09,620
Yeah. I'm back.

626
00:56:10,895 --> 00:56:12,506
Hi, Bruce.

627
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:19,008
Nat.

628
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,404
This is awkward.

629
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:27,772
So we gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

630
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,115
And they can clearly find us.

631
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,562
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

632
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,940
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

633
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,284
took a deal. It was too tough on their
families, they're on house arrest.

634
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,857
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

635
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:40,281
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

636
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:41,306
Okay, look...

637
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:44,332
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

638
00:56:44,348 --> 00:56:48,296
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

639
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,997
Vision's stone.

640
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:54,978
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

641
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,778
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

642
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:03,061
But also, its composition.

643
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:05,758
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

644
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,843
powerful energy
source, something,

645
00:57:07,868 --> 00:57:11,637
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

646
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:15,570
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

647
00:57:15,704 --> 00:57:18,026
And you, with it.

648
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,778
We're not having
this conversation.

649
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,381
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

650
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:26,979
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

651
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:34,453
Only you have the
power to pay it.

652
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:39,749
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

653
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:43,209
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

654
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:44,369
But it should.

655
00:57:46,176 --> 00:57:47,608
We don't trade lives, Vision.

656
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:51,996
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your
life to save how many millions of people.

657
00:57:52,021 --> 00:57:54,132
Tell me, why is
this any different?

658
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:57,502
Because you might have a choice.

659
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:01,818
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

660
00:58:01,827 --> 00:58:05,567
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

661
00:58:05,606 --> 00:58:09,404
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

662
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:12,602
- You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
- I'm saying that...

663
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:16,341
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

664
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,540
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

665
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,595
Not me. Not here.

666
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:24,942
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

667
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:28,863
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

668
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:33,085
I know somewhere.

669
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:49,651
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

670
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,497
And the Border Tribe?

671
00:58:51,522 --> 00:58:55,713
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.

672
00:58:55,753 --> 00:58:58,317
M'Baku likes a good fight.

673
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,698
Ewe Kunga.
[Yes my King.]

674
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,102
And what of this one?

675
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:04,885
This one may be tired of war.

676
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,835
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

677
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:32,433
Where's the fight?

678
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:34,904
On its way.

679
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:56,585
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

680
00:59:57,513 --> 00:59:59,991
I have never failed him.

681
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:07,700
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

682
01:00:07,725 --> 01:00:11,486
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

683
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:14,396
There would be judgment.

684
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:24,768
Give me...

685
01:00:28,618 --> 01:00:30,587
the Stone.

686
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:44,893
Wow. You are a seriously loyal
piece of head-o-ware, aren't you.

687
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,012
Yeah, uh...
Speaking of loyalty...

688
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:50,107
- What the...!
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

689
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:51,133
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

690
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,850
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about you...

691
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,043
- And now I gotta hear it.
- ...and I kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

692
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:58,202
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

693
01:00:58,216 --> 01:01:01,330
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

694
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:02,958
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

695
01:01:02,974 --> 01:01:04,522
And now I'm here in space.

696
01:01:04,534 --> 01:01:07,099
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

697
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:09,399
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

698
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:11,325
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

699
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:13,195
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

700
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,003
- I did think this through.
- You could not have possibly thought this through.

701
01:01:15,022 --> 01:01:19,338
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

702
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:24,041
Okay, that didn't really make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

703
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:28,743
Come on. We got a situation.

704
01:01:28,896 --> 01:01:32,430
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

705
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,783
Um. Okay, okay. Uh...

706
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:37,928
OK, did you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

707
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:44,121
Painful, aren't they?

708
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:47,944
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

709
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:50,289
And any one of them...

710
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:57,772
...could end your friend's
life in an instant.

711
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,923
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

712
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:03,536
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

713
01:02:04,256 --> 01:02:06,110
You'll save nothing.

714
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:10,668
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

715
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:13,343
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

716
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:27,265
Yes!

717
01:02:27,726 --> 01:02:29,791
Wait, what are those?

718
01:02:44,215 --> 01:02:46,593
Hey, we haven't officially met.

719
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,430
Cool.

720
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:53,849
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

721
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:55,681
- Great.
- I want to protect the stone.

722
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:58,481
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

723
01:02:58,497 --> 01:03:01,468
For what? Nearly
blasting me into space?

724
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,260
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

725
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:06,514
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

726
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:08,860
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

727
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,690
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

728
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:12,950
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

729
01:03:12,975 --> 01:03:15,495
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

730
01:03:15,696 --> 01:03:16,850
billions of miles from Earth,

731
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,075
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

732
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,081
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

733
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:25,351
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

734
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:29,090
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

735
01:03:29,115 --> 01:03:31,538
Oh, you're using your
made-up names. Um,

736
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:33,377
I'm Spider-Man, then.

737
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:36,357
This ship is self-correcting its course.
The thing's on autopilot.

738
01:03:36,382 --> 01:03:39,970
Can we control it? Fly us home?

739
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:44,322
- Stark.
- Yeah?

740
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:47,130
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. I heard you.

741
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:51,415
I'm not so sure we should.

742
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:55,723
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

743
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,359
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

744
01:03:58,384 --> 01:04:00,720
What? No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

745
01:04:00,732 --> 01:04:03,310
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

746
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:06,688
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

747
01:04:06,713 --> 01:04:08,785
And I don't know what to do.

748
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:12,425
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

749
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:15,882
But you saw what they
did, what they can do.

750
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:18,537
At least, on his turf
he's not expecting it.

751
01:04:18,573 --> 01:04:22,649
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

752
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:26,142
Do you concur?

753
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:31,408
All right, Stark. We go to him.

754
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:33,863
But you have to understand...

755
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:38,541
If it comes to saving you, or
the kid, or the Time Stone...

756
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:42,194
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

757
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:46,379
I can't. Because the
Universe depends on it.

758
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:49,884
Nice. Good, moral compass.

759
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,033
We're straight.

760
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:55,457
All right, kid...

761
01:04:56,342 --> 01:04:58,960
You're an Avenger now.

762
01:05:33,592 --> 01:05:36,298
I thought you might be hungry.

763
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,273
I always hated that chair.

764
01:05:50,288 --> 01:05:52,088
So I've been told.

765
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:56,743
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

766
01:05:57,177 --> 01:06:00,961
I hated this room, this ship...

767
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:03,774
I hated my life.

768
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:09,777
You told me that, too.

769
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,923
Every day.

770
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,611
For almost twenty years.

771
01:06:21,117 --> 01:06:23,596
I was a child when you took me.

772
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:27,121
I saved you.

773
01:06:29,593 --> 01:06:35,635
No. No. We were happy
on my home planet.

774
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:39,553
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

775
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:44,473
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

776
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,075
You know what's happened since then?

777
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:51,151
The children born have
known nothing but full

778
01:06:51,163 --> 01:06:54,787
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

779
01:06:56,368 --> 01:06:58,785
Because you murdered
half the planet.

780
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,594
A small price to
pay for salvation.

781
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:05,011
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

782
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:08,249
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

783
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:12,512
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

784
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:16,780
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

785
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:19,830
I'm the only one who knows that.

786
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:24,529
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

787
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:28,479
For a time...

788
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:30,325
You...

789
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:33,843
had that same will,

790
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:39,522
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

791
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,918
I'm not your daughter.

792
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:47,603
Everything I hate about
myself, you taught me.

793
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:51,899
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

794
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:58,106
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

795
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:04,135
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

796
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,622
I am disappointed.

797
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:09,672
But not because
you didn't find it.

798
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:16,034
But because you did.

799
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:18,833
And you lied.

800
01:08:35,503 --> 01:08:37,207
Nebula!

801
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:45,292
Don't do this.

802
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,729
Some time ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

803
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:53,162
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

804
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:58,352
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

805
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:08,380
Stop. Stop it.

806
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:16,270
I swear to you, on my life...

807
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:20,201
I never found the Soul Stone.

808
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:24,537
Accessing memory files.

809
01:09:24,562 --> 01:09:26,407
You know what he's about to do.

810
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:29,488
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

811
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:33,602
- He'll never get them all.
- He will.  - He can't, Nebula.

812
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:37,724
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

813
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,408
I burned it.

814
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,703
You're strong.

815
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:49,565
Me.

816
01:09:51,419 --> 01:09:55,227
The generous... me.

817
01:09:57,248 --> 01:09:59,906
I never taught you to lie.

818
01:09:59,922 --> 01:10:02,846
That's why you're so bad at it.

819
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:09,040
Where is the Soul Stone?

820
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,395
Vormir.

821
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,879
The stone is on Vormir.

822
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:53,415
Show me.

823
01:10:54,902 --> 01:10:56,129
I am Groot.

824
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,549
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking, what's there to see?

825
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,259
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

826
01:11:01,263 --> 01:11:02,521
I am Groot!

827
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:04,290
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

828
01:11:04,315 --> 01:11:05,548
then go in the cup again.

829
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:06,710
You speak Groot?

830
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:08,850
Yes, they toured on Asgard,
it was an elective.

831
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:11,978
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

832
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:16,689
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

833
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,824
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

834
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,188
It's truly awesome.

835
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:32,838
Okay. Time to be the captain.

836
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:41,720
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

837
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:45,249
Well, he's been dead before.

838
01:11:45,288 --> 01:11:48,611
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

839
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:52,521
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

840
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:56,520
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

841
01:11:56,567 --> 01:12:00,250
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

842
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:06,065
Are you sure you're up to
this particular murder mission?

843
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,222
Absolutely!

844
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:12,184
Oh, rage and, uh,
vengeance, anger...

845
01:12:12,193 --> 01:12:15,094
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

846
01:12:15,106 --> 01:12:17,901
They really clear the mind,
so I'm, uh, good to go.

847
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:21,022
Yeah, but, I mean, this
Thanos we're talking about,

848
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:23,047
he's the toughest there is.

849
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,269
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

850
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:26,943
He's never fought me twice.

851
01:12:27,274 --> 01:12:29,845
And I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

852
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,623
Well, it better be some hammer.

853
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:39,117
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

854
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:41,257
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

855
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:43,262
every one of them
would've rather killed me

856
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:44,914
but none succeeded.

857
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:47,910
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

858
01:12:47,931 --> 01:12:51,107
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards

859
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:55,320
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

860
01:12:56,315 --> 01:12:59,161
And what if you're wrong?

861
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,103
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

862
01:13:04,485 --> 01:13:07,927
What more could I lose?

863
01:13:19,336 --> 01:13:23,801
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

864
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:29,003
Okay.

865
01:13:29,926 --> 01:13:33,732
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

866
01:13:33,757 --> 01:13:36,299
- you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

867
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:37,461
What's it look like?

868
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:40,742
Some jerk lost a bet
with me on Contraxia.

869
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,174
- And he gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

870
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,724
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

871
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:50,822
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

872
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:57,133
Ooh!

873
01:13:57,463 --> 01:13:59,903
I would've washed that. Ahem.

874
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:02,952
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my a--

875
01:14:03,465 --> 01:14:05,160
Hey, we're here.

876
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:12,852
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

877
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,563
But it ain't the eye.

878
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:33,916
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

879
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:37,474
And the rings are frozen.

880
01:14:56,428 --> 01:15:00,760
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are cleaning.

881
01:15:04,974 --> 01:15:08,468
Maybe they realized that they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

882
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:11,910
This forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

883
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:17,783
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

884
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:20,833
Did it look anything like that?

885
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:27,440
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

886
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:34,032
Eitri, wait! Stop!

887
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:38,087
Thor?

888
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:45,378
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

889
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:51,479
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

890
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:56,887
Eitri, the glove... What did you do?

891
01:16:09,506 --> 01:16:13,455
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

892
01:16:13,634 --> 01:16:17,231
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

893
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:22,087
I made what he wanted.

894
01:16:22,425 --> 01:16:27,484
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

895
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:33,963
And he...and he killed everyone anyway.

896
01:16:36,147 --> 01:16:38,681
All except me.

897
01:16:38,805 --> 01:16:42,089
"Your life is yours," he said.

898
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:46,853
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

899
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:49,645
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

900
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:51,866
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

901
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:56,050
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

902
01:16:56,401 --> 01:17:00,194
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

903
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:06,388
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

904
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,288
Mantis, listen very carefully.

905
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:51,081
I need you to meet me on Titan.

906
01:17:57,138 --> 01:17:59,663
- Hey, what's going on?
- I think we're here.

907
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:02,667
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

908
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:06,186
Get your hand inside the steering gimble.
Close those around it.

909
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:07,944
Okay. Yeah.

910
01:18:07,968 --> 01:18:11,737
Understand? Now we gotta be one big guy, so we
gotta move at the same time.

911
01:18:11,743 --> 01:18:12,744
Okay. Ready?

912
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:21,020
We might, uh, wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

913
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,049
You all right?

914
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:54,842
That was close.

915
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:56,883
I owe you one.

916
01:18:56,915 --> 01:19:01,231
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

917
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,937
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

918
01:19:03,962 --> 01:19:06,244
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. You understand?

919
01:19:06,268 --> 01:19:08,668
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

920
01:19:14,953 --> 01:19:16,783
Thanos!

921
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:39,692
Whoa whoa whoa please don't
put your eggs in me!

922
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:42,148
Stay down, clown!

923
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:51,196
Die, Blanket of Death!

924
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:59,719
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

925
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:03,019
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

926
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:04,402
Where is Gamora?

927
01:20:04,427 --> 01:20:07,163
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

928
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:10,409
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

929
01:20:10,434 --> 01:20:13,435
Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

930
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,105
Let's do it. Just shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

931
01:20:17,204 --> 01:20:20,799
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

932
01:20:20,824 --> 01:20:21,784
She's right. You can't.

933
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:23,640
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

934
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,582
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

935
01:20:27,607 --> 01:20:29,943
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

936
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,187
Let me ask you this one time...

937
01:20:32,212 --> 01:20:34,315
What master do you serve?

938
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:37,743
What master do I serve? What,
am I supposed to say "Jesus"?

939
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,011
- You're from Earth.
- I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

940
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:42,623
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

941
01:20:42,648 --> 01:20:47,221
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

942
01:20:47,345 --> 01:20:50,097
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

943
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:51,926
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

944
01:20:52,518 --> 01:20:54,233
We're the Avengers, man.

945
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:57,959
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

946
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:02,055
Yeah. Tall guy, not that
good-looking. Needed saving.

947
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:05,065
Where is he now?

948
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:20,612
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

949
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,433
It's a mold.

950
01:21:23,064 --> 01:21:27,389
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

951
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:30,304
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

952
01:21:30,565 --> 01:21:32,246
Does it have a name?

953
01:21:33,532 --> 01:21:34,851
Stormbreaker.

954
01:21:35,017 --> 01:21:38,068
That's a bit much.

955
01:21:38,397 --> 01:21:40,719
So how do we make it?

956
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:43,316
You'll have to restart the forge.

957
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:48,058
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

958
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,364
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

959
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:57,712
What the hell happened
to this planet?

960
01:21:57,737 --> 01:21:59,500
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

961
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:02,507
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

962
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:06,869
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

963
01:22:06,909 --> 01:22:09,695
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

964
01:22:09,749 --> 01:22:11,050
Or at least the beginnings of one.

965
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:13,787
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

966
01:22:13,994 --> 01:22:17,497
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

967
01:22:17,522 --> 01:22:18,869
Are you yawning?

968
01:22:19,975 --> 01:22:22,157
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

969
01:22:22,182 --> 01:22:23,895
Did you hear what I said?

970
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,609
I stopped listening after you
said "we need a plan."

971
01:22:26,617 --> 01:22:27,643
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

972
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,143
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

973
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:32,341
What exactly is it that they do?

974
01:22:32,366 --> 01:22:35,541
- Kick names, take ass.
- Yeah. That's right.

975
01:22:41,905 --> 01:22:43,471
All right, just get over here, please?

976
01:22:44,021 --> 01:22:46,340
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

977
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:49,556
Mr. Lord?
Star-Lord is fine.

978
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:51,893
We've gotta coalesce.

979
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:53,968
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

980
01:22:53,976 --> 01:22:57,995
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

981
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:01,874
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

982
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:05,316
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

983
01:23:05,341 --> 01:23:07,373
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

984
01:23:07,385 --> 01:23:08,443
What dance-off?

985
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:11,191
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

986
01:23:11,215 --> 01:23:14,898
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

987
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,243
- It never was.
- Don't encourage this, alright?

988
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,076
- We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

989
01:23:20,101 --> 01:23:22,712
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

990
01:23:22,743 --> 01:23:25,847
I'm half-human. So that
50% of me that's stupid,

991
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:29,006
- That's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

992
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:30,460
Excuse me?

993
01:23:31,118 --> 01:23:35,309
But does your friend
often do that?

994
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,796
Strange! We all right?

995
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:51,914
- You're back. You all right? - I am.
- Hey, what was that?

996
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:56,099
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures.

997
01:23:56,405 --> 01:24:00,284
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

998
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:04,397
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

999
01:24:05,844 --> 01:24:08,667
How many do we win?

1000
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:13,772
One.

1001
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:38,604
The Stone had
better be up there.

1002
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:43,695
For your sister's sake.

1003
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:08,501
Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars.

1004
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,295
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1005
01:25:13,419 --> 01:25:14,772
You know us?

1006
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:19,612
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

1007
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:22,123
Where is the Soul Stone?

1008
01:25:22,148 --> 01:25:24,259
You should know,

1009
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:27,935
it extracts a terrible price.

1010
01:25:28,825 --> 01:25:31,398
I'm prepared.

1011
01:25:33,064 --> 01:25:36,778
We all think that at first.

1012
01:25:39,883 --> 01:25:42,901
We are all wrong.

1013
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:56,428
How is it you know
this place so well?

1014
01:25:56,453 --> 01:26:01,050
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

1015
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:06,126
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

1016
01:26:06,181 --> 01:26:08,402
Banished me here.

1017
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:12,664
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

1018
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:24,454
What you seek lies
in front of you.

1019
01:26:24,611 --> 01:26:27,816
As does what you fear.

1020
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:31,296
- What's this?
- The price.

1021
01:26:31,382 --> 01:26:36,293
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1022
01:26:36,955 --> 01:26:41,596
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1023
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,373
Tell me what it needs.

1024
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:48,145
To ensure that
whoever possesses it,

1025
01:26:48,192 --> 01:26:51,657
understands its power...

1026
01:26:51,696 --> 01:26:55,590
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

1027
01:26:55,675 --> 01:26:57,216
Of what?

1028
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:59,537
In order to take the Stone...

1029
01:26:59,569 --> 01:27:02,908
You must lose that
which you love.

1030
01:27:05,004 --> 01:27:09,547
A soul, for a soul.

1031
01:27:24,026 --> 01:27:27,208
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

1032
01:27:27,263 --> 01:27:29,773
a moment...

1033
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,865
when you got
what you deserved.

1034
01:27:34,038 --> 01:27:37,580
And I was always
so disappointed.

1035
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:42,123
But, now...

1036
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:48,809
You kill, and torture,

1037
01:27:50,413 --> 01:27:53,579
and you call it mercy.

1038
01:27:56,364 --> 01:27:59,398
The Universe has judged you.

1039
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:03,434
You asked it for a prize and

1040
01:28:03,634 --> 01:28:05,847
and it told you, no.

1041
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:08,678
You failed.

1042
01:28:09,235 --> 01:28:11,846
And do you wanna know why?

1043
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,062
Because you love nothing.

1044
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:16,125
No one.

1045
01:28:27,308 --> 01:28:31,453
Really? Tears?

1046
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,002
They are not for him.

1047
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:49,803
No.

1048
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,953
This isn't love.

1049
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:56,465
I ignored my destiny once.

1050
01:28:57,725 --> 01:29:00,001
I cannot do that again.

1051
01:29:00,656 --> 01:29:02,347
Even...

1052
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:04,607
for you.

1053
01:29:28,093 --> 01:29:30,947
I'm sorry, little one.

1054
01:31:12,423 --> 01:31:15,802
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

1055
01:31:15,872 --> 01:31:17,628
I hope you're right about this,

1056
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,720
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

1057
01:31:36,114 --> 01:31:38,778
When you said we were going
to open Wakanda to the

1058
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:41,361
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

1059
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:43,347
And what did you imagine?

1060
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:47,132
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

1061
01:32:00,692 --> 01:32:04,023
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1062
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:07,182
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1063
01:32:07,862 --> 01:32:11,741
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

1064
01:32:11,766 --> 01:32:14,341
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1065
01:32:14,353 --> 01:32:16,997
Uh, sir. Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1066
01:32:17,013 --> 01:32:19,781
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

1067
01:32:19,821 --> 01:32:23,699
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

1068
01:32:24,059 --> 01:32:27,672
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

1069
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,473
How have you been, Buck?

1070
01:32:31,498 --> 01:32:34,965
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

1071
01:32:47,554 --> 01:32:50,127
The structure is polymorphic.

1072
01:32:50,166 --> 01:32:53,333
Right. We, we had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

1073
01:32:53,349 --> 01:32:58,424
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

1074
01:32:58,533 --> 01:33:02,232
Because... we didn't think of it?

1075
01:33:02,248 --> 01:33:05,618
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

1076
01:33:05,798 --> 01:33:09,183
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1077
01:33:09,223 --> 01:33:12,851
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

1078
01:33:12,922 --> 01:33:16,526
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

1079
01:33:16,551 --> 01:33:19,600
As long as you can give me.

1080
01:33:22,643 --> 01:33:27,030
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1081
01:33:41,586 --> 01:33:44,151
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

1082
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,780
God, I love this place.

1083
01:33:55,796 --> 01:34:00,456
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

1084
01:34:18,468 --> 01:34:22,176
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

1085
01:34:22,201 --> 01:34:25,805
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

1086
01:34:25,807 --> 01:34:30,561
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

1087
01:34:30,586 --> 01:34:31,656
I will.

1088
01:34:31,703 --> 01:34:35,260
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1089
01:34:35,277 --> 01:34:38,772
and get this man a shield!

1090
01:34:47,168 --> 01:34:49,805
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1091
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:52,623
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1092
01:34:52,635 --> 01:34:55,069
you're gonna need something a
lot bigger to yank them loose!

1093
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:57,204
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1094
01:34:57,212 --> 01:35:01,270
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a rope and a...

1095
01:35:08,707 --> 01:35:11,279
Fire the engines!

1096
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:30,731
More power, rabbit!

1097
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:03,911
Well done, boy.

1098
01:36:04,546 --> 01:36:08,339
That's Nidavellir!

1099
01:36:27,134 --> 01:36:30,183
- Damn it.
- Damn it? What's damn it?

1100
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,272
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1101
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,512
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

1102
01:36:34,537 --> 01:36:38,556
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1103
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:43,137
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1104
01:36:43,162 --> 01:36:46,282
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1105
01:36:55,051 --> 01:36:59,070
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1106
01:37:01,469 --> 01:37:06,380
Whoa, this is amazing, Nat! It's like
being the Hulk without actually...

1107
01:37:09,206 --> 01:37:10,989
I'm okay.
I'm okay!

1108
01:37:12,716 --> 01:37:16,454
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1109
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:30,733
- ([Now!])
- ([Yes!])

1110
01:37:33,513 --> 01:37:37,117
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])

1111
01:37:37,232 --> 01:37:41,236
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo!

1112
01:37:43,414 --> 01:37:45,892
Thank you for standing with us.

1113
01:37:45,924 --> 01:37:47,910
[Of course, brother.]

1114
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:10,060
Where's the other friend?

1115
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:12,946
You will pay for his
life with yours.

1116
01:38:13,361 --> 01:38:16,214
Thanos will have that stone.

1117
01:38:16,285 --> 01:38:17,754
That's not gonna happen.

1118
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:20,312
You are in Wakanda now.

1119
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:24,856
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1120
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,658
We,

1121
01:38:26,858 --> 01:38:29,611
have blood to spare.

1122
01:38:40,371 --> 01:38:44,602
- Did they surrender?
- Not exactly.

1123
01:38:54,632 --> 01:38:56,966
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1124
01:38:57,296 --> 01:38:59,575
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1125
01:38:59,665 --> 01:39:01,868
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1126
01:39:01,982 --> 01:39:03,483
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1127
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:13,420
What the hell?

1128
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,877
Looks like we pissed her off.

1129
01:39:27,817 --> 01:39:30,468
They're killing themselves.

1130
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:43,522
- [Shields!]
- [Shields!]

1131
01:39:47,132 --> 01:39:48,933
[Fire!]

1132
01:40:05,683 --> 01:40:07,197
You see the teeth on those things?

1133
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,929
Alright, back up, Sam, or you're
gonna get your wings singed.

1134
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:24,354
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1135
01:40:24,524 --> 01:40:26,276
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

1136
01:40:26,477 --> 01:40:28,404
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

1137
01:40:28,429 --> 01:40:30,828
How do we do that?

1138
01:40:32,077 --> 01:40:34,267
We open the barrier.

1139
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:40,331
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1140
01:40:40,379 --> 01:40:42,661
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

1141
01:40:42,671 --> 01:40:44,554
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1142
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:48,199
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1143
01:40:48,794 --> 01:40:53,180
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1144
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:57,001
Foola! [Drop shields!]

1145
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,140
Wakanda forever!

1146
01:41:07,351 --> 01:41:09,251
Wakanda forever!

1147
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:20,555
Now!

1148
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:53,851
- How much longer, Shuri?
- I've barely begun, brother.

1149
01:41:54,009 --> 01:41:56,604
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1150
01:42:02,878 --> 01:42:04,997
All fathers, give me strength.

1151
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:06,401
You understand, boy?

1152
01:42:06,716 --> 01:42:10,152
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

1153
01:42:10,809 --> 01:42:12,811
It'll kill you.

1154
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:15,525
Only if I die.

1155
01:42:15,564 --> 01:42:20,608
Yes, that's what
killing you means.

1156
01:42:47,545 --> 01:42:50,337
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1157
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:42,875
Thor? Say something, come on.

1158
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:45,831
Thor, you okay?

1159
01:43:49,351 --> 01:43:53,690
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1160
01:43:54,425 --> 01:43:57,145
Where's the handle?

1161
01:43:58,749 --> 01:44:02,425
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1162
01:45:10,135 --> 01:45:12,121
There's too many of them!

1163
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:42,349
You guys are so screwed now!

1164
01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:48,823
Bring me Thanos!

1165
01:46:20,331 --> 01:46:22,169
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:28,107
You're much more of a Thanos.

1167
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,251
I take it the Maw is dead?

1168
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:36,731
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1169
01:46:37,874 --> 01:46:40,555
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1170
01:46:40,564 --> 01:46:42,103
You may regret that.

1171
01:46:42,303 --> 01:46:46,358
He brought you face-to-face with
the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1172
01:46:48,884 --> 01:46:52,020
Where do you think
he brought you?

1173
01:46:52,064 --> 01:46:56,278
Let me guess.
Your home?

1174
01:46:59,556 --> 01:47:01,457
It was.

1175
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,462
And it was beautiful.

1176
01:47:07,455 --> 01:47:09,656
Titan was like most planets.

1177
01:47:09,857 --> 01:47:12,969
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1178
01:47:12,992 --> 01:47:17,113
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1179
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,365
Genocide?

1180
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:23,714
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1181
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:27,194
And they called me a madman.

1182
01:47:27,336 --> 01:47:31,542
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1183
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,876
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

1184
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,611
I'm a survivor.

1185
01:47:36,627 --> 01:47:39,059
Who wants to murder trillions.

1186
01:47:39,138 --> 01:47:43,149
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1187
01:47:43,212 --> 01:47:48,352
And they would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1188
01:47:49,705 --> 01:47:52,497
And then what?

1189
01:47:52,786 --> 01:47:54,536
I finally rest.

1190
01:47:54,736 --> 01:47:58,620
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1191
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:03,492
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1192
01:48:03,782 --> 01:48:09,647
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1193
01:48:09,967 --> 01:48:11,898
"Our"?

1194
01:48:16,846 --> 01:48:21,554
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1195
01:48:58,937 --> 01:49:00,868
Boom!

1196
01:49:01,337 --> 01:49:03,840
Don't let him close his fist.

1197
01:49:07,429 --> 01:49:10,697
Magic! More magic!

1198
01:49:10,933 --> 01:49:12,069
Magic with a kick!

1199
01:49:12,391 --> 01:49:14,424
Magic with a...

1200
01:49:14,665 --> 01:49:16,448
Insect.

1201
01:49:53,633 --> 01:49:56,063
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1202
01:49:56,226 --> 01:49:59,377
It would've been a
waste of parts!

1203
01:50:03,312 --> 01:50:05,861
Where's Gamora?

1204
01:50:45,553 --> 01:50:47,015
Is he under? Don't let up.

1205
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,855
Be quick. He is very strong.

1206
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:53,784
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1207
01:50:59,358 --> 01:51:01,016
We gotta open his
fist to get it off.

1208
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,762
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1209
01:51:04,681 --> 01:51:06,464
Not so strong now, huh?

1210
01:51:06,903 --> 01:51:09,404
Where's Gamora?

1211
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,126
- My Gamora!
- No, bullshit!

1212
01:51:13,158 --> 01:51:15,550
Where is she?

1213
01:51:15,597 --> 01:51:18,826
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1214
01:51:19,733 --> 01:51:20,734
He...

1215
01:51:20,759 --> 01:51:22,484
He mourns.

1216
01:51:22,508 --> 01:51:26,887
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1217
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:29,124
Gamora...

1218
01:51:31,712 --> 01:51:33,182
What?

1219
01:51:33,206 --> 01:51:40,142
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1220
01:51:41,259 --> 01:51:45,270
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?

1221
01:51:45,739 --> 01:51:49,132
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1222
01:51:50,267 --> 01:51:53,551
Tell me she's lying.

1223
01:51:53,715 --> 01:51:57,148
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1224
01:51:58,203 --> 01:52:01,886
I had to.

1225
01:52:02,088 --> 01:52:05,092
No you didn't.

1226
01:52:08,048 --> 01:52:11,513
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1227
01:52:11,662 --> 01:52:13,577
Kid, stop! Stop, stop!|Stop, stop!

1228
01:52:13,677 --> 01:52:17,045
It's coming, it's coming!
I got it, I got it!

1229
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,646
Oh, God.

1230
01:53:19,789 --> 01:53:23,324
Come and get some, space-dogs!

1231
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:29,861
Come on! Get some, get some!
Get some, come on, get some!

1232
01:53:30,612 --> 01:53:33,388
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1233
01:53:33,435 --> 01:53:36,141
Okay, how much for the arm?

1234
01:53:37,032 --> 01:53:39,597
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1235
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:51,513
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1236
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:55,681
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1237
01:53:55,706 --> 01:53:58,263
I am Groot!

1238
01:53:58,873 --> 01:54:01,266
I am Steve Rogers.

1239
01:54:20,469 --> 01:54:23,463
Fall back! Fall back now!

1240
01:54:31,836 --> 01:54:34,423
Focus that fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1241
01:54:34,448 --> 01:54:36,567
I'm doing it.

1242
01:54:59,258 --> 01:55:01,525
Why was she up there
all this time?

1243
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:05,045
She's on the field. Take it.

1244
01:55:35,882 --> 01:55:39,323
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1245
01:55:41,224 --> 01:55:44,344
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1246
01:55:44,369 --> 01:55:45,877
On my way.

1247
01:55:50,631 --> 01:55:53,571
He'll die alone. As will you.

1248
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:55,542
She's not alone.

1249
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:22,967
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1250
01:56:22,992 --> 01:56:25,141
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1251
01:56:25,153 --> 01:56:27,410
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1252
01:56:31,839 --> 01:56:35,170
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1253
01:56:36,381 --> 01:56:40,111
Hulk? Hulk? I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1254
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:44,154
Well this is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1255
01:56:47,313 --> 01:56:51,067
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

1256
01:56:51,661 --> 01:56:57,401
- No!
- Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1257
01:56:57,409 --> 01:57:00,975
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1258
01:57:13,662 --> 01:57:15,835
See ya!

1259
01:57:26,474 --> 01:57:29,375
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1260
01:57:40,075 --> 01:57:42,398
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1261
01:57:43,259 --> 01:57:45,911
But you're dying like any man.

1262
01:57:54,201 --> 01:57:56,289
Get outta here!

1263
01:57:59,003 --> 01:58:00,934
Go!

1264
01:58:18,507 --> 01:58:20,688
That was really gross.

1265
01:58:47,302 --> 01:58:50,047
I thought I told you to go.

1266
01:58:50,125 --> 01:58:52,823
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1267
01:59:02,977 --> 01:59:05,682
I got you, I got you!

1268
01:59:05,713 --> 01:59:08,466
Sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1269
01:59:52,935 --> 01:59:55,789
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1270
01:59:56,283 --> 02:00:01,076
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1271
02:00:02,588 --> 02:00:04,785
A fake.

1272
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:15,539
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1273
02:00:15,609 --> 02:00:18,033
- Stark.
- You know me?

1274
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:23,342
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1275
02:00:24,093 --> 02:00:26,243
My only curse is you.

1276
02:00:56,729 --> 02:01:00,123
All that for a drop of blood.

1277
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,402
You have my respect, Stark.

1278
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:50,423
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1279
02:01:55,122 --> 02:01:58,274
I hope they remember you.

1280
02:02:07,284 --> 02:02:09,278
Stop.

1281
02:02:14,675 --> 02:02:19,640
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1282
02:02:22,241 --> 02:02:24,759
No tricks.

1283
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,585
Don't!

1284
02:03:21,096 --> 02:03:23,363
One to go.

1285
02:03:32,598 --> 02:03:35,029
Where is he?

1286
02:03:42,885 --> 02:03:45,989
Did we just lose?

1287
02:03:48,329 --> 02:03:51,440
Why would you do that?

1288
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:56,520
We're in the endgame now.

1289
02:04:00,253 --> 02:04:02,856
Ooo! Bafa!

1290
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:06,969
- Ya hoo hoo ([We come!])
- Bafa! ([To die!]) - Ya hoo hoo!

1291
02:04:21,595 --> 02:04:23,917
Are you okay?

1292
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:28,061
What? What is it?

1293
02:04:29,117 --> 02:04:31,549
He's here.

1294
02:04:41,496 --> 02:04:46,243
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1295
02:04:47,103 --> 02:04:50,137
What the hell?

1296
02:05:15,303 --> 02:05:18,595
Cap. That's him.

1297
02:05:20,096 --> 02:05:23,833
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1298
02:05:47,515 --> 02:05:50,596
Wanda. It's time.

1299
02:05:50,635 --> 02:05:51,730
No.

1300
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:54,044
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

1301
02:05:54,091 --> 02:05:57,330
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1302
02:05:57,355 --> 02:06:00,245
- Don't.
- You must do it Wanda. Please...

1303
02:06:01,414 --> 02:06:04,769
We are out of time.

1304
02:06:04,794 --> 02:06:09,408
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1305
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:14,743
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1306
02:06:15,274 --> 02:06:16,662
It's not fair.

1307
02:06:18,117 --> 02:06:20,936
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1308
02:06:21,664 --> 02:06:23,187
It's all right.

1309
02:06:24,147 --> 02:06:26,864
You could never hurt me.

1310
02:06:35,308 --> 02:06:38,663
I just feel you.

1311
02:08:16,475 --> 02:08:18,687
I love you.

1312
02:08:47,474 --> 02:08:50,273
I understand, my child.

1313
02:08:50,955 --> 02:08:53,927
Better than anyone.

1314
02:08:54,224 --> 02:08:56,585
You could never.

1315
02:09:01,017 --> 02:09:04,903
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1316
02:09:05,747 --> 02:09:09,336
But now is no time to mourn.

1317
02:09:10,604 --> 02:09:12,535
Now...

1318
02:09:12,606 --> 02:09:16,180
is no time at all.

1319
02:09:38,148 --> 02:09:40,915
No!

1320
02:10:37,066 --> 02:10:39,630
I told you...

1321
02:10:39,850 --> 02:10:43,579
You'd die for that.

1322
02:10:56,363 --> 02:10:58,756
You should have...

1323
02:11:00,421 --> 02:11:03,079
You...

1324
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:08,295
You should have
gone for the head!

1325
02:11:09,681 --> 02:11:12,074
No!

1326
02:11:43,790 --> 02:11:46,230
Daughter?

1327
02:11:52,722 --> 02:11:54,966
Did you do it?

1328
02:11:56,059 --> 02:11:58,468
Yes.

1329
02:12:05,486 --> 02:12:08,386
What did it cost?

1330
02:12:10,583 --> 02:12:13,711
Everything.

1331
02:12:22,574 --> 02:12:24,544
What did you do?

1332
02:12:25,474 --> 02:12:28,101
What did you do?!

1333
02:12:40,567 --> 02:12:42,757
Where did he go?

1334
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:47,199
Thor...

1335
02:12:49,264 --> 02:12:50,875
Where did he go?

1336
02:12:50,977 --> 02:12:53,236
Steve?

1337
02:13:26,978 --> 02:13:29,151
Up, General, up!

1338
02:13:29,944 --> 02:13:31,482
This is no place to die.

1339
02:13:43,485 --> 02:13:45,587
Wakan? ([Great Spirit?])

1340
02:13:46,439 --> 02:13:48,511
I am Groot.

1341
02:13:48,535 --> 02:13:49,793
No.

1342
02:13:50,607 --> 02:13:54,954
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1343
02:13:55,242 --> 02:13:57,212
No...

1344
02:14:09,705 --> 02:14:12,434
Sam?

1345
02:14:14,968 --> 02:14:18,478
Sam, where you at?

1346
02:14:25,826 --> 02:14:29,344
Something's happening.

1347
02:14:40,135 --> 02:14:42,621
Quill?

1348
02:14:48,732 --> 02:14:52,243
- Steady, Quill.
- Oh, man.

1349
02:14:55,442 --> 02:14:57,139
Tony.

1350
02:14:59,924 --> 02:15:03,990
There was no other way.

1351
02:15:08,321 --> 02:15:10,432
Mr. Stark?

1352
02:15:13,584 --> 02:15:17,134
I don't feel so good.

1353
02:15:17,314 --> 02:15:21,240
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1354
02:15:22,459 --> 02:15:25,868
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Sir, please...

1355
02:15:25,893 --> 02:15:28,629
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1356
02:15:32,701 --> 02:15:35,868
I'm sorry.

1357
02:15:49,035 --> 02:15:51,507
He did it.

1358
02:16:15,295 --> 02:16:19,190
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1359
02:16:35,474 --> 02:16:38,336
Oh, God.

1360
02:17:29,691 --> 02:17:39,745
SUBTITLES BY...
Kicked names: [1st draft] iamdepressed69 & Clarity.
Took A**: [completed] Scram.Cypher.

1361
02:17:39,787 --> 02:17:47,795
ONE STINGER SCENE AFTER ALL CREDITS

1362
02:27:33,252 --> 02:27:35,310
Still no word from Stark?

1363
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:36,444
No not yet.

1364
02:27:36,544 --> 02:27:39,535
We're watching every satellite on
both hemispheres but still nothing.

1365
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:44,120
- What is it?
- Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1366
02:27:44,321 --> 02:27:46,060
Same energy signature as New York?

1367
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:47,683
Ten times bigger.

1368
02:27:48,875 --> 02:27:51,337
- Tell Klein we'll meet him at...
- Nick! Nick!

1369
02:28:05,061 --> 02:28:06,761
They okay?

1370
02:28:06,961 --> 02:28:08,593
There's no one here.

1371
02:28:18,810 --> 02:28:20,680
Call control.

1372
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:22,641
Code red.

1373
02:28:22,841 --> 02:28:24,465
Nick.

1374
02:28:25,582 --> 02:28:26,620
Hill?

1375
02:28:41,701 --> 02:28:43,461
Aw no!

1376
02:28:44,254 --> 02:28:46,256
Motherf---
