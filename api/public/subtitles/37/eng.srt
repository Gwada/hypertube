Boom.

194

six elemental crystals...

195

hurtling across
the virgin universe.

196

Tell me his name again.

205
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:06,528
Thanos.

206
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,029
He's a plague, Tony.

207
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,064
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

208
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,301
He wipes out
half the population.

209
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,570
He sent Loki.

210
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,508
The attack on New York,
that's him.

211
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,276
This is it.

212
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,377
What's our timeline?

213
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,978
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

214
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,912
That already makes him

215
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:26,615
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

216
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,151
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

217
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,286
He could destroy life

218
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,455
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

219
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,457
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

220
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,626
Are you seriously leaning

I'm going to allow that.

223
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,569
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

224
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,203
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

225
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,438
No can do.

226

the Time Stone with our lives.

231

A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

232
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:03,217
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

233
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:04,319
Point is, things change.

234
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,422
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

235
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,590
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

236
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:10,491
Yeah, so conversely,

237
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,627
it may also be
his best chance against us.

238

Well, if we don't do our jobs.

Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

243
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,406
The fact is
we have this stone.

244
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,141
We know where it is.

245
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,544
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

246
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:31,314

What do you mean?

249
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,085
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

250
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:38,252
He's offline.

251

- What?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,656
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

253
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,192
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

254
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,562
Who could find Vision then?

00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:42,323
This... This is a man.

490
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:45,259
A handsome, muscular man.

491
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,327
I'm muscular.

492
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,395
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

493
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,963
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

494
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:49,964
PETER: Yeah, right.

495
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,499
DRAX: It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

496
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,701
What?

497
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:56,806
Gamora, do you think I'm...

498
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:02,843
He is anxious, angry.

499
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,447
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

500
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,317
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

501
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,284
PETER: Wow.

502
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,486
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

503
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:15,389
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

504
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:16,457
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

505
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,092
ROCKET: You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

506
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:19,327
GAMORA: It's like his muscles

507
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:21,395
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

508
00:30:21,397 --> 00:30:23,166
Stop massaging his muscles.

509
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:24,999
(THUD)

510
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,002
Wake him up.

511
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:30,338
(SOFTLY) Wake.

Who the hell are you guys?

517
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:56,430
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

518
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:58,266
To bring balance
to the universe

519
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,335
by wiping out
half of all life.

520
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:03,571
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

521
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:05,305
massacre by massacre.

522
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:06,940
Including my own.

523
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:08,542
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

524
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,911
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

525
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:14,515
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

526
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:18,353
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

527
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,459
Your father killed my brother.

528
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,226
Oh, boy.

529
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:28,094
Stepfather, technically.

530
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,032
And she hates him
as much as you do.

531
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:35,368
THOR: Families can be tough.

532
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,903
Before my father died,

533
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:38,639
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

534
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:41,174
that he imprisoned in Hel.

535
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:44,277
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

536
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,646
So I had to kill her.

537
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,947
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

538
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,151
Goes round and round and...

539
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:51,151
I feel your pain.

540
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:53,520
I feel your pain as well,
because...

541
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:54,921
I mean,
it's not a competition,

542
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:56,156
but I've been through a lot.

543
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,024
- My father killed my mother.
- (SLURPING)

544
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,192
And then I had to kill
my father.

545
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:00,927
- That was hard.
- (SIGHS)

546
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,264
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

547
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:07,300
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

548
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,071
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

549
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:14,441
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

550
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:17,143
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

551
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:20,513
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

(IN DEEP VOICE)
No, you're not.

554
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:29,456
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

555
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,960
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

556
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,529
- No.
- You are.

557
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,432
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

558
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:40,933
No, I'm not.

559
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:42,937
- (GASPS) He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

560
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,443
Are you mocking me?

561
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:53,979
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

562
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:55,047
He's trying to copy me.

563
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,181
I need you to stop doing that.

564
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,016
- GAMORA: Enough!
- He's doing it first.

565
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,452
We need to stop Thanos.

566
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:01,153
Which means
we need to find out

567
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,288
where he's going next.

568
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,623
Knowhere.

569
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,492
He must be going somewhere.

570
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:07,627
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, no. Knowhere?

571
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:10,497
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

572
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:13,366
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

573
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,636
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

574
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:18,103
THOR: Because for years...

575
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:20,305
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

576
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:21,974
with a man
called the Collector.

577
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:23,576
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

578
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,478
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

579
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,112
- Or a genius.
- GAMORA: How do you know...

580
00:33:27,114 --> 00:33:29,682
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

581
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:32,317
There are six stones
out there.

582
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,621
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

583
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:38,424
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

584
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:40,593
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

585
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,462
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

586
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,230
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

587
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,498
They're with the Avengers.

588
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,034
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

589
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:50,269
Like Kevin Bacon?

590
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,570
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

591
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,638
I haven't been there
in a while.

592
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,207
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

593
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,042
No one even knows where it is.

594
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:58,711
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

595
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,412
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

596
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,081
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

597
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,249
You're welcome.

598
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,551
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

599
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:09,655
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

600
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,657
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

601
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,060
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

602
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,695
That place is a legend.

603
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,297
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

604
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,466
(CHUCKLING)
to ever torment the universe.

605
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,634
I would very much like
to go there, please.

606
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:23,702
The rabbit is correct

607
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:24,803
and clearly the smartest
among you.

608
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:25,838
Rabbit?

609
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,507
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

610
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:29,808
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

611
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,143
You're very perceptive.

612
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,377
You seem like a noble leader.

613
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,179
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

614
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:37,149
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

615
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:39,084
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

616
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,252
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

617
00:34:40,254 --> 00:34:41,453
THOR: Quiet.

618
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,121
- That's my backpack.
- ROCKET: Go sit down.

619
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,757
PETER: Look, this is my ship.

620
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,559
And I'm not goin' to...

621
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:49,762
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

622
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:51,830
The Thanos-killing kind.

623
00:34:51,832 --> 00:34:53,565
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

624
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,734
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

625
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:57,068
Your bodies would crumble

626
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,337
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

627
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:00,405
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

628
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:01,673
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

629
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,140
If we don't go to Knowhere

630
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,743
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

631
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:06,512
he'll be too powerful to stop.

632
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:08,781
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

633
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:10,616
We got two ships

634
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:12,250
and a large assortment
of morons.

635
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:15,587
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

636
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:16,789
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

637
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,590
to try to stop Thanos.

638
00:35:18,592 --> 00:35:20,659
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

639
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,694
PETER: For the record...

640
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,228
I know that
you're going with him

641
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,430
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

642
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,098
You know, you really shouldn't

643
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,202
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

644
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,870
Come on, Groot.

645
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:34,706
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

646
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,175

of standing
so incredibly still...

But my movement...

was so slow...

820
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,085
that it's imperceptible.

I sold it.

Why would I lie?

840
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:28,142
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

841
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,909
Like suicide.

842
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,278
You do understand.

843
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,415
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

844
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,216
I didn't know what it was.

845
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:41,186
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

846
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:42,321
It's him.

He doesn't have the stone yet.

If we get it,
then we can stop him.

We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,008
Then we have to protect it.

978
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,711
No, we have to destroy it.

979
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,146
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

980
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,480
to this entity in my head.

981
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,515
About its nature.

982
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:03,786
But also its composition.

983
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,854
I think if it were exposed

984
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,856
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

985
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:11,727
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

986
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,964
its molecular integrity
could fail.

987
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,732
Yeah, and you with it.

988
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:20,434
We're not having
this conversation.

989
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,503
VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

990
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,940
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

991
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,110
That's too high a price.

992
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,017
Only you have
the power to pay it.

993
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,588
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

994
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,158
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

995
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,694
But it should.

996
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,729
We don't trade lives, Vision.

997
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,831
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

998
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,800
to save how many
millions of people?

999
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,969
Tell me,
why is this any different?

1000
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,406
BANNER: Because you might
have a choice.

1001
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,974
Your mind is made up

1002
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,610
of a complex construct
of overlays.

1003
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:06,213
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

1004
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,082
All of them mixed together,

1005
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,984
all of them
learning from one another.

1006
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,919
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

1007
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:15,122
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

1008
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,724
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

1009
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,559
Perhaps the best parts.

1010
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,829
Can we do that?

1011
00:58:20,596 --> 00:58:22,630
Not me, not here.

1012
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,131
RHODES: Well,
you better find someone

1013
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,599
and somewhere fast.

1014
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:26,967
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

1015
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,137
have your old rooms back.

1016
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:32,842
I know somewhere.

1017
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:48,822
OKOYE: The Kingsguard

1018
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,190
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

1019
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:52,192
And the Border Tribe?

1020
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,094
Those that are left.

1021
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:56,529
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

1022
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,665
M'Baku likes a good fight.

(SPEAKS XHOSA)

And what of this one?

1025
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:05,672
This one may be tired of war.

1026
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:08,710
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

1027
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:32,901
Where's the fight?

1028
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:35,171
On its way.

In all the time
I've served Thanos...

1032
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:00,061
I have never failed him.

1033
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:08,335
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

1034
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:10,069
with the Time Stone
still attached

1035
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:12,339
to your vaguely
irritating person...

1036

(GRUNTS)

1040
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:29,991
the stone.

1041
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:43,936
Wow, you're a seriously

1042
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,138
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

speaking of loyalty...

STARK: What the...

1045
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:50,877
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

1046
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:51,911
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

1047
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:53,346
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

1048
01:00:53,348 --> 01:00:54,247
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

1049
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:55,314
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

1050
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:57,884

intuitive, by the way.

God damn it.

1052
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,988
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

1053
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,389
- What did you just say?
- (STUTTERS) I take that back.

1054
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:04,957
And now, I'm here in space.

1055

Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

1059
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:13,900
No, I did think this through.

1060
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:15,700
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

1061

You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

- Go.
- Um...

Okay, okay... Uh...

to run. Great plan.

how you fit your head
into that helmet.

Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

I tried to bench you.
You refused.

Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

- Yeah.

Can you get us home?

1119
01:03:46,453 --> 01:03:47,853
Yeah, I heard you.

1120
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:51,458
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1121
01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:53,857
Under no circumstances

1122
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:56,428
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1123
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,828
I don't think
you quite understand

1124
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,763
what's at stake here.

1125
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:01,366
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1126
01:04:01,368 --> 01:04:04,302
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1127
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:06,036
Since he sent an army
to New York

1128
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:07,805
and now he's back.

1129
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:09,873
And I don't know what to do.

1130
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,008
So I'm not so sure

1131
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,043
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1132
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:16,880
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1133
01:04:16,882 --> 01:04:19,183
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1134
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:22,119
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1135
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:23,122
Doctor.

1136
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,426
Do you concur?

1137
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:31,465
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1138
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:34,898
But you have to understand...

1139
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,501
if it comes to saving you

1140
01:04:36,503 --> 01:04:39,203
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1141
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:42,940
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1142
01:04:42,942 --> 01:04:47,144
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1143
01:04:47,146 --> 01:04:50,049
Nice. Good, moral compass.

1145
01:04:53,986 --> 01:04:55,388
(SIGHS) All right, kid.

You're an Avenger now.

THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1148
01:05:48,674 --> 01:05:50,474
I always hated that chair.

1149
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:53,243
THANOS: So I've been told.

1150
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:57,183
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1151
01:05:57,982 --> 01:05:59,418
I hated this room.

1152
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,685
This ship.

1153
01:06:01,687 --> 01:06:03,522
I hated my life.

1154
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:10,262
THANOS: You told me that too.

1155
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:14,899
Every day.

1156
01:06:17,536 --> 01:06:19,505
For almost 20 years.

1157
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,477
I was a child
when you took me.

1158
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:26,645
I saved you.

1159
01:06:30,248 --> 01:06:31,248
No.

1160
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:36,420
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1161
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,154
Going to bed hungry...

1162
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:40,056
scrounging for scraps.

1163
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:43,025
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1164
01:06:43,027 --> 01:06:45,462
I'm the one who stopped that.

1165
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,464
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1166
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:49,666
The children born...

1167
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:53,302
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1168
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,507
It's a paradise.

1169
01:06:57,242 --> 01:06:59,275
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1170
01:06:59,277 --> 01:07:02,311
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1171
01:07:02,313 --> 01:07:03,446
You're insane.

1172
01:07:03,448 --> 01:07:05,548
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1173
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:09,018
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1174
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,356
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1175
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:14,557
It needs correction.

1176
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,060
You don't know that!

1177
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:20,363
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1178
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:24,536
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1179
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:27,205
For a time...

1180
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:34,078
you had that same will...

1181

as you fought by my side.

1182

Daughter.

1183
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:42,487
I'm not your daughter.

1184
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,625
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1185
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,059
And, in doing so,

1186
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:52,263
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1187

That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

I am disappointed.

But not because
you didn't find it.

with is a plucky attitude...

Dude, don't call us plucky.

All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

it might be really good.

- (STAMMERS) It's nothing.

1457
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:11,574
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1458
01:23:11,576 --> 01:23:13,509
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1459
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:15,243

01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:19,080

- We're getting no help

1463
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:20,616
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1464

1477

THANOS: The stone
had better be up there.

For your sister's sake.

Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

THANOS: You know us?

1488

It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1489

Where is the Soul Stone?

You should know...

1491
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,244
it extracts a terrible price.

1492
01:25:29,513 --> 01:25:31,180
I am prepared.

this place so well?

1496
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:01,676
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

I even held one in my hand.

1498

But it cast me out,
banished me here.

RED SKULL: The price.

1504
01:26:31,908 --> 01:26:37,611
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1505
01:26:37,613 --> 01:26:41,684
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1506
01:26:43,185 --> 01:26:45,185
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1507
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:48,756
RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1508
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:51,393
understands its power...

1509
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:56,296
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1510
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:58,265
Of what?

1511
01:26:58,267 --> 01:27:00,300
In order to take the stone,

1512
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:02,638
you must lose
that which you love.

1513
01:27:05,574 --> 01:27:06,809

1514

01:27:27,764 --> 01:27:29,263
a moment...

01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:32,601
when you got
what you deserved.

And I was always
so disappointed.

1520
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:42,243
But now...

1521
01:27:46,214 --> 01:27:49,283
You kill and torture...

1522
01:27:51,252 --> 01:27:53,254
and you call it mercy.

1523
01:27:57,325 --> 01:27:59,394
The universe has judged you.

1524
01:28:00,863 --> 01:28:05,433
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1525
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:08,469
You failed.

1526
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:11,674
And do you wanna know why?

1527
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,509
Because you love nothing.

1528
01:28:15,276 --> 01:28:16,780

They're not for him.

01:28:53,448 --> 01:28:55,983
