1
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,678
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

2
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,415
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

3
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,787
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

4
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,255
3170. We're being held up.

5
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:22,291
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

6
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:25,261
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use them.

7
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:27,397
Take your foot off the gas,

8
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:30,631
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

9
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,600
or we will forcibly
remove you!

10
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,907
Fucking do it! Now!

11
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,276
Your choice! Go!

12
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,962
What the fuck!

13
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,996
He fucking went for his gun.

14
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,168
He spilled his fucking coffee.

15
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:12,976
Shit.

16
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:13,979
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

17
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,078
Copy.

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,648
Thirty out. Hustle!

19
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,754
- Pop it.
- Ready.

20
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,464
Man on!

21
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:41,670
Out of fucking time.

22
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,339
Prepare to engage.

23
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:44,874
Contact right!

24
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,442
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

25
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,124
Contact left!

26
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,697
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

27
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,512
We are under heavy fire!

28
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,668
Fuck!

29
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:51,943
Motherfucker!

30
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,787
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

31
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,974
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

32
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,625
What the fuck was that?

33
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,095
Did you see him
go for his gun?

34
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,301
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

35
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:58,073
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

36
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,979
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

37
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:20,661
Go right on Doty.

38
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:21,866
<i>Right on Doty.</i>

39
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:32,001
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

40
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,073
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

41
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,840
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

42
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,107
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

43
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,412
What the fuck was that?

44
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,285
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

45
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,126
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

46
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,128
Catch any tails?

47
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,270
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

48
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,607
Femoral artery. He's done.

49
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,446
Well, we knew the risks.

50
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,450
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

51
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:26,792
Hey, B.

52
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,958
Get back over there.

53
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,094
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

54
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,628
They'll supersede Gardena,

55
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,136
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

56
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,741
All clear? No GPS?

57
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,813
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

58
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,649
We've got to
get this patched up.

59
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:54,486
We need this clean.

60
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,428
You good?

61
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,832
We're cop killers now.

62
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,292
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

63
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:36,961
No?

64
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,528
Good morning,
fellow officers.

65
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,864
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

66
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,965
Yeah?

67
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,901
I take it he's a bad guy.

68
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,700
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

69
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,703
shotgun, and gas mask?

70
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,307
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

71
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,310
Rough night?

72
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,976
Yes. Next subject?

73
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,811
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

74
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,748
I think he
looks amazing.

75
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,183
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

76
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,052
Thursday.

77
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:06,254
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

78
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:07,723
Please.

79
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,392
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

80
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,927
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

81
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,662
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

82
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,831
- That's some real donut.
- Okay, what's the tally?

83
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,366
Those are horrendous, dude.

84
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,769
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

85
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,772
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

86
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:25,574
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

87
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,243
Surrounded the truck.

88
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,912
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

89
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:33,282
AP rounds blasted through
the windshield took him out.

90
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:37,085
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

91
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,454
They knew the route.

92
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,423
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

93
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:44,929
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

94
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:49,864
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

95
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,201
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

96
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,769
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

97
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,131
But there was nothing
in the truck.

98
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,809
Nothing in the truck?

99
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,813
They stole a fucking
empty armored truck?

100
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,412
Yup.

101
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,283
Why the fireworks?

102
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:10,406
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

103
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,621
Genius.

104
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,623
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

105
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,392
That's a cold car.

106
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:19,594
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it.

107
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,263
They bleach-bombed it.

108
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:26,502
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

109
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:38,279
Ah, fuck. I can't deal with
this retard factory this early.

110
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,981
One of you guys handle it?

111
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,118
It's all you, bro.

112
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,153
Thank you.

113
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,755
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

114
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,423
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

115
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,161
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

116
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:56,865
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

117
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,167
Talk to DOT, okay?

118
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,436
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

119
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,342
And find me
that fucking truck.

120
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:11,180
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

121
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,449
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

122
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,187
How's that
mean tennis game?

123
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,191
Look at you, man.

124
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,026
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

125
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:27,395
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

126
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,831
I mean, how does
a county sheriff

127
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,533
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

128
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,903
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage.

129
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,138
Look at you.

130
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,173
This thing's tits!

131
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,542
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

132
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,644
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

133
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,416
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

134
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,719
You just threw
a donut in the hot zone.

135
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,486
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

136
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,555
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

137
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:55,890
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

138
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,694
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up with that?

139
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,061
I like you.

140
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:02,230
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

141
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,734
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

142
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,835
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

143
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:08,903
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

144
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:12,610
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

145
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,946
Yet.

146
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,683
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

147
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,256
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

148
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,188
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,927
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

150
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,467
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

151
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:42,604
and then these clowns
took over.

152
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,239
Who are they, LASD?

153
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,109
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

154
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,380
He seemed to be in charge.

155
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,326
You recognize him?

156
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:07,495
He played football at South.

157
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:10,468
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

158
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,234
Yeah.

159
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,235
That's the cop
who blasted him.

160
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,138
Runs Major Crimes.

161
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,976
Get to know your enemy, boys.

162
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,784
Who's running this crew?

163
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,354
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

164
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:37,326
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

165
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,494
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

166
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,962
Why didn't they dump it, then?

167
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,132
- I'll check the salvage yards.
- All of them.

168
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:47,369
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

169
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:51,705
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

170
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,210
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

171
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:57,178
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

172
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,849
Okay, inside job, but where?

173
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:03,687
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

174
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,290
What about Merrimen?

175
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,359
When did he parole again?

176
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,165
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

177
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,700
We need to find
that fucking truck.

178
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,735
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

179
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:22,071
Yeah.

180
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:23,071
The one who was
hanging out with Merrimen?

181
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:24,705
What bar did he work in?

182
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,709
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

183
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,047
Let's pay him a visit.

184
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:42,560
...some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

185
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:46,731
- Thanks.
- All right.

186
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,398
Wolfgang, talk to me.

187
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,432
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

188
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,067
Put it on my tab, all right?

189
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,668
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

190
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,906
Have a good night.

191
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,183
Are we doing this?

192
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:10,788
Yeah, man. All right, man.

193
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,588
To money and women.

194
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,793
That we don't have.

195
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,628
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

196
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,231
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

197
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,100
Lots of reps man.

198
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,702
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

199
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,273
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

200
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,443
Wrap it up.

201
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,978
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

202
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,383
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

203
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:41,453
A gift.

204
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,384
How about a tip?

205
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,119
We got you last time.

206
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,621
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

207
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,059
That's not how it works.

208
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,665
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

209
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,405
Need change?

210
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,142
That's for you, <i>Fräulein.</i>

211
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,444
Thanks.

212
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,645
Are there always
so many cops in here?

213
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,016
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

214
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:17,085
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

215
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,020
Right.

216
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:22,026
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

217
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:27,328
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

218
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,666
Rick's in <i>Casablanca</i>
type shit.

219
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,370
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

220
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:37,839
You know, give him a couple of
drinks, steak on his plate,

221
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,606
some nice women around him,

222
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,312
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

223
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,014
Loose lips sink ships.

224
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,184
Ain't that the truth.

225
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,287
Mmm, what about you?

226
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,489
Pull a lot of pussy
in here? Yeah?

227
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,556
Come on.

228
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,362
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

229
00:17:58,295 --> 00:17:59,663
I'd fuck you.

230
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:03,801
Kidding.

231
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,140
All right.

232
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,644
I'm out.

233
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,881
See you later, man.

234
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,251
Yeah.

235
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,054
Look forward to it.

236
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,751
- <i>Fräulein.</i>
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

237
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:13,067
What the fuck?

238
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,123
What's up, gangster?

239
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,223
Oh, Peaches.

240
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,594
Oh, <i>Fräulein,</i> you're up.

241
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,965
Sit down.
You sit right there.

242
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,969
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

243
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:49,473
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

244
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,179
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

245
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,480
Borracho!

246
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:00,651
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

247
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,325
Why my pants wet?

248
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:13,693
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

249
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,797
are into some
homo shit, I'm good.

250
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,135
Y'all just kill me now.

251
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,471
You pissed yourself, bubba.

252
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,503
It happens.

253
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:25,841
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

254
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:28,176
But y'all got the wrong dude.

255
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:30,510
You got me confused
with someone.

256
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,015
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

257
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,681
What'd you say?

258
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,517
Dude something?

259
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,522
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

260
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,690
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

261
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:46,161
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

262
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,527
We know exactly who you are.

263
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,663
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

264
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,633
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

265
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:53,801
That's nice.

266
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:55,873
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

267
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,641
178.

268
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,748
Speed demon!

269
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,049
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

270
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,211
What reason did you give him?

271
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,087
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

272
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:15,824
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

273
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,226
<i>Me gusta.</i>

274
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,428
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

275
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,397
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

276
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:27,435
All right, girls, time to go.

277
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,770
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

278
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,105
Time to go home
to your babies.

279
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,027
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

280
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:44,185
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

281
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,787
You need to fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

282
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,425
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

283
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,930
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

284
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:59,800
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

285
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,772
What you think?
How you feel about that?

286
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:07,209
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

287
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:11,880
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

288
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:19,958
Do you know what this means?

289
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,326
It means I am
a member of a clique.

290
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,327
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

291
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:29,964
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

292
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:32,836
which means you are done.

293
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,339
He ain't lying.

294
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,310
Let me ask you this.

295
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:45,513
Okay, do we look like the
types who will arrest you?

296
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:48,619
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

297
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,118
Hmm?

298
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

299
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,855
No. Not at all.

300
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:57,459
Right, exactly.

301
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,832
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

302
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,469
So tell me,

303
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,974
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

304
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,474
You're a pussy.

305
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,675
Those dudes are bad dudes.

306
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,780
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

307
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,682
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

308
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:23,852
Talk shop?

309
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:25,820
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

310
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,890
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

311
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:30,325
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

312
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,996
No, it fucking isn't.

313
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:36,397
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

314
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:38,366
This dude just comes to
my bar where I work...

315
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:41,672
Stop. Shut up.

316
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,412
Come on, man. This is
some weird shit. Just...

317
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:53,315
You listen to me, fuckface.

318
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,049
We don't give
a shit about you.

319
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,387
You in Merrimen's crew?

320
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:00,491
Hmm?

321
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,690
Huh? You hit the stadium?

322
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,194
You talky-talky now?

323
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,564
Yes, please.

324
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:15,773
Fuck!

325
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,212
I'm just the driver!

326
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,782
I'm just the driver!

327
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:30,584
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

328
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,953
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

329
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,556
That's it. Fuck!

330
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,460
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

331
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:40,095
I don't know, all right?

332
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:41,962
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

333
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,230
If the cops come down on me,

334
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,267
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

335
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,567
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

336
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,805
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

337
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:52,874
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

338
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,779
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

339
00:24:56,946 --> 00:25:00,117
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

340
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,120
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing, hmm?

341
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,324
Good stuff.

342
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,571
All right,
when did you meet him?

343
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:12,093
What do I get out of this?

344
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,134
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

345
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:18,836
Two,

346
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,807
you're not the bad guys.

347
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:24,809
We are.

348
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:33,613
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

349
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,983
<i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i>

350
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,651
<i>We started talking.</i>

351
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:39,488
This is my boy, Bosco.

352
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,959
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

353
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,128
Hey, the kid can drive.

354
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,497
Okay.

355
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:51,499
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

356
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:54,671
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

357
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,841
What were their names?

358
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,675
Hawaiian dude,

359
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:02,880
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

360
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:08,115
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

361
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:10,154
I told him I needed
some extra money,

362
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:13,020
so he gave me a job.

363
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,358
Who's that? Merrimen?

364
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:17,995
Merrimen.

365
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,862
<i>Ray Merrimen.</i>

366
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,505
So what's up with this dude?

367
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,741
It's Marcus' boy.

368
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,709
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

369
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,346
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

370
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,549
He was a Marine for a minute.

371
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,688
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

372
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:50,761
All right,
let's check him out.

373
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,395
<i>Real smart dude.</i>

374
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,733
<i>He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.</i>

375
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,407
You ready to roll, Ray?

376
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,077
514!

377
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,785
Come on, let's cuff them up.

378
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:34,271
See you soon, Ray.

379
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:41,776
No, you won't.

380
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:43,411
<i>Where'd you meet him?</i>

381
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,146
<i>It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.</i>

382
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:51,452
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

383
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:53,223
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

384
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,127
Hey.

385
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:00,461
Oh, shit. What's up?

386
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,465
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

387
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,634
Thank you. Thank you.

388
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,511
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

389
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:17,613
Yeah, a little bit.

390
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:21,485
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

391
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:28,989
Silver dollar pancakes.

392
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,161
Three of them.

393
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:33,330
Where you from?

394
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:34,865
Hawthorne.

395
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,368
So you can drive, huh?

396
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,502
Oh, I can drive.

397
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,543
Drive.

398
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,514
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

399
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,141
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

400
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:38,893
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

401
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:40,897
<i>We hit this rave at a stadium.</i>

402
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,229
Got one.

403
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,819
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

404
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,957
The count is on.

405
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,961
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

406
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:49,963
Why don't we
just call it a day?

407
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,833
Really?

408
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:54,268
You want three in hot bills,

409
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,305
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

410
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,343
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

411
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,945
I'm just saying.

412
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,682
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

413
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,487
Put it away.

414
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:11,789
We're trading up.

415
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:18,162
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

416
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,195
What happened to the cash?

417
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:22,531
I don't know.

418
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:24,634
They don't tell me.

419
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,170
They don't talk much.

420
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:32,674
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

421
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,883
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

422
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,285
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

423
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:45,555
We'll be in touch.

424
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,006
Yeah?

425
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,179
<i>Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.</i>

426
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,307
Jesus Christ!

427
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,676
You scared the shit out of me,
babe. Can't do that.

428
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:50,180
What are you doing right now?

429
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:57,154
You erasing your recent calls?

430
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:03,156
My phone? What do you mean?

431
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:05,993
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

432
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:08,329
"I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that."

433
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:09,499
Come on.

434
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,501
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

435
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:15,537
Where you been?

436
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:21,177
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

437
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:24,144
Been at work?

438
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:28,016
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

439
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,519
Of course, I was at work.

440
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,977
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

441
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,696
What was so hot, then?

442
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:41,732
Is that a work text?

443
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:43,633
Huh?

444
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:50,703
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

445
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:54,878
Who does that?

446
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:04,052
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

447
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:05,088
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,224
Me, too.

449
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:21,038
Fuck.

450
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,438
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

451
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,840
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

452
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,275
And we have
something else to do.

453
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:29,578
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

454
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,213
Hey, yo.

455
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,081
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

456
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,416
- Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

457
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:37,784
- Is Daddy coming with us?
- What are you doing, Deb?

458
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:40,054
What the fuck are you doing?

459
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,555
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

460
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,092
Seriously,
what are you doing?

461
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:45,558
Is Daddy coming with us?

462
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,360
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

463
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:49,764
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

464
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,798
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

465
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,769
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

466
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:58,075
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

467
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:00,807
Yeah, great. Great.

468
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:03,110
Hey. Come here, honey.

469
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,611
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

470
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:06,780
but I'm gonna come
a little later, okay?

471
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:08,282
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

472
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,217
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

473
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,786
Will you slow it down
a second?

474
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:13,153
Give Daddy some rest.
He's real tired.

475
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:14,789
- Right, hon?
- What...

476
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:17,995
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

477
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:20,627
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

478
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,896
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

479
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,298
Deb, can you slow it...

480
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,665
Okay. Come on.

481
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,436
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

482
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,771
Here we go. Okay, baby, ready?

483
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,773
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

484
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,640
Let's go.

485
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:37,777
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

486
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,848
Where's the pink bag?

487
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:42,115
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

488
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,184
Oh, great language right
in front of my daughter.

489
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:45,618
Great fathering!

490
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,487
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

491
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:50,458
- "My kids," huh? "My kids?"
- Great fathering!

492
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,496
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

493
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,632
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

494
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:58,836
Please don't do this.

495
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:02,206
Please.

496
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:18,152
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

497
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,155
Okay...

498
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:24,065
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

499
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:28,527
Get the fuck
out of here, you fucker!

500
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:30,130
You motherfucker!

501
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:34,235
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

502
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,705
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

503
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:38,674
Good. Good.

504
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:47,884
Okay. Mommy's okay.

505
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:58,560
See you later.

506
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,203
Perfect.

507
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,074
Morning.

508
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,560
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

509
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,963
Got a hit on our
dead guy from Angel City.

510
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,565
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

511
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,636
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

512
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:45,571
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

513
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,775
And more to the point
that you were making before,

514
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:51,544
he was stationed at Twentynine Palms
the same time Merrimen was there.

515
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,467
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

516
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,421
Look to your right.

517
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:00,954
You know what that is?

518
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,490
It's the bank for banks.

519
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:06,961
Los Angeles branch
of the Federal Reserve.

520
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,099
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

521
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:19,440
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

522
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:22,443
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

523
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:25,246
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

524
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:27,148
If they see your face again,

525
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,318
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

526
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,321
The place is case-proof.

527
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:37,958
There have been
53 break-in attempts.

528
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,762
Not one has
got past the lobby.

529
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,801
That's why
we're going to rob it.

530
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,101
Okay, here we go.

531
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:50,371
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

532
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:53,974
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

533
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,844
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

534
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:58,878
<i>As soon as
you enter the lobby,</i>

535
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,481
<i>computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.</i>

536
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,649
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

537
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,518
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

538
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,956
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

539
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,191
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

540
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:14,195
<i>Access is severely restricted.</i>

541
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:16,463
<i>Two stories below street level
is the vault floor.</i>

542
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,667
By the way,

543
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,367
uh, his crimey...

544
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,471
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

545
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:24,070
He serve with Merrimen?

546
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,340
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

547
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,744
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

548
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:33,313
<i>Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.</i>

549
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:37,217
<i>This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.</i>

550
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,420
<i>Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.</i>

551
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:45,025
<i>At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,</i>

552
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:48,660
<i>every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.</i>

553
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,364
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

554
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:54,001
I got this from the HR desk
at Twentynine Palms.

555
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:57,604
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

556
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:02,041
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

557
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,911
both MARSOC fast Marines.

558
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:06,746
But there's a hitch.

559
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:10,050
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

560
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,452
<i>So, if a note goes missing,</i>

561
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:12,952
<i>they're going to know
exactly which one it is.</i>

562
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,687
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

563
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:18,690
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

564
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:19,927
that person can be tracked.

565
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:22,228
Okay. Bosco,
the peckerwood?

566
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,398
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

567
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,101
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

568
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:30,237
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

569
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,873
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

570
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,874
That's where they linked up.

571
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:38,611
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharged.

572
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,313
So, the way I see it,

573
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,081
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

574
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,318
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

575
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,088
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

576
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,990
<i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i>

577
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:53,327
<i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i>

578
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:55,094
<i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i>

579
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,663
<i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i>

580
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,233
<i>If the bank is off at all,</i>

581
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:01,068
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

582
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,806
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

583
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:09,443
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

584
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,744
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

585
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:15,647
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

586
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:17,952
that money
has ceased to exist.

587
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,518
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

588
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,923
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

589
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:25,625
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

590
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,696
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

591
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,367
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

592
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,469
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

593
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,438
In the $100 count room alone,

594
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,108
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

595
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,609
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

596
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,948
<i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i>

597
00:42:46,615 --> 00:42:47,818
It's all destroyed.

598
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:55,054
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

599
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:57,358
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

600
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,728
and brought out to the dump.

601
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:02,396
If we can get to
those unfit bills

602
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:05,698
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

603
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,469
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

604
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:09,669
Bingo.

605
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,039
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

606
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,707
Same thing, only this time Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

607
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:20,713
Goes to prison till 2016. Now in
that time, while he was in prison,

608
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:23,816
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

609
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:25,551
None, but you're
on a roll. Keep going.

610
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:29,490
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

611
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:30,559
They left him. Why?

612
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:37,030
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

613
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,768
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

614
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,337
Gangbangers, these are not.

615
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:46,773
Okay, these are our guys.

616
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:50,746
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

617
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:53,717
This is the crew.

618
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,454
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

619
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,758
We're not going in this way.

620
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,962
We're going in that way.

621
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:17,737
What's going on
with <i>Fräulein?</i>

622
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,641
We can move on him
anytime we want.

623
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,576
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

624
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,947
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

625
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:29,083
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

626
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:30,818
Thank you.

627
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,786
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

628
00:44:32,788 --> 00:44:34,887
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

629
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,322
What?

630
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,992
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

631
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:40,327
Get off your wallet, buddy.

632
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,996
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

633
00:44:41,998 --> 00:44:43,764
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

634
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,065
Got an alligator arm.

635
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:48,434
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

636
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,072
Nicholas O'Brien?

637
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,106
Yeah?

638
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,110
I suggest you take these.

639
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:57,679
You're being served.

640
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:00,146
You kidding me?

641
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:01,483
I'm afraid not.

642
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:04,788
What's going on?

643
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,987
You all right, bro?

644
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:09,458
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

645
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,094
He say "divorced"?

646
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:15,130
Yo.

647
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:18,831
Welcome to the fucking club.

648
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,668
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

649
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,722
There's a closer view.

650
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:44,391
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

651
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:46,326
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

652
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:48,027
Okay.

653
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:50,463
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

654
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:53,665
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

655
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,703
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

656
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:59,373
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

657
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,542
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

658
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:06,079
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

659
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:08,882
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

660
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:10,918
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

661
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,088
I'd say yes, but I'd like
to have data to be sure.

662
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,654
Great.

663
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:18,057
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

664
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:19,893
They run on their
own power supply,

665
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:22,496
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

666
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:26,099
The solve here is
we run an EMP burst.

667
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:29,535
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

668
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,573
Where you get all this
information from?

669
00:46:33,409 --> 00:46:35,575
You don't have to
worry about that.

670
00:46:35,577 --> 00:46:37,280
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

671
00:46:38,947 --> 00:46:40,748
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

672
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,119
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

673
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,268
<i>How many handlers do you need?</i>

674
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,501
<i>Uh, gate B right now.</i>

675
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,269
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

676
00:47:05,306 --> 00:47:07,242
<i>Force leaving loading dock B.</i>

677
00:47:20,155 --> 00:47:21,157
ID?

678
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:30,599
Sign in, please.

679
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:42,674
Keep this on you
at all times.

680
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:45,447
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

681
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:50,453
Buzz him in. He's good.

682
00:47:51,987 --> 00:47:53,490
Smells good.

683
00:47:54,924 --> 00:47:56,159
He's good. Let him in.

684
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:18,511
- Sharon?
- Mmm-hmm. That's me.

685
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:21,014
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

686
00:48:21,016 --> 00:48:23,453
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

687
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:25,651
She ain't getting none.

688
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,054
Shut up. Really?

689
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:30,389
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

690
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:32,658
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

691
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,028
Lunch. Dessert.
Lunch. Dessert.

692
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,032
Bye, sunshine.

693
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:10,433
There he goes.

694
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:23,880
My gosh.

695
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:26,081
Aw!

696
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:36,726
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

697
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:47,800
Damn, girl looking fine.

698
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:50,304
Thank you.
You look amazing.

699
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,438
How are you?

700
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,273
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

701
00:49:54,275 --> 00:49:56,309
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

702
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,878
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

703
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,280
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

704
00:50:03,786 --> 00:50:04,985
Thank you.

705
00:50:04,987 --> 00:50:06,822
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

706
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:11,157
Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.

707
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,463
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

708
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:19,667
Let me holler at him
for a second.

709
00:50:21,904 --> 00:50:23,338
Let me talk to you, bruh.

710
00:50:31,413 --> 00:50:34,483
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

711
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,291
So here's what's up.

712
00:50:44,293 --> 00:50:46,259
For the past 16 years,

713
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:48,929
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

714
00:50:48,931 --> 00:50:51,130
and my responsibility only.

715
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:55,337
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

716
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,804
Don't fuck up,

717
00:50:57,806 --> 00:50:59,505
or your mama
will weep as she has

718
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:02,444
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

719
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:09,181
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

720
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,683
Do you understand?

721
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:13,019
Yeah. Yes, sir.

722
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,327
It's all right.
It's all right.

723
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:22,195
Listen. Listen.

724
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:24,798
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

725
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,869
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

726
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:30,139
I'll see you at 11:30.

727
00:51:30,873 --> 00:51:32,371
Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:35,143
- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.

729
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:44,552
I think he got
the picture, bro.

730
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:50,726
Psst.

731
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:25,025
Beers and sake,
let's go.

732
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:27,463
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

733
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,596
Hey.

734
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:04,633
Buddy.

735
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:07,900
Donnie, right?

736
00:53:07,902 --> 00:53:09,802
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:11,669
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

738
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,273
Yeah, man. How you doing?

739
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,844
What's up, fellows?

740
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,580
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

741
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:21,417
You look familiar.

742
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:24,087
No, I'm not from around here.

743
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,324
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

744
00:53:31,259 --> 00:53:33,425
Enjoying my dinner, man.

745
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:34,793
- Really?
- Yeah.

746
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:35,797
Food here sucks.

747
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:41,636
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

748
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:48,511
So I'll see ya
at the gym, man.

749
00:53:53,114 --> 00:53:56,115
Yeah. Definitely.

750
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:57,487
Have a good night.

751
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:08,161
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

752
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,299
We wore the same
number, 55, right?

753
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,564
I went to South Torrance.

754
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:15,467
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

755
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,137
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

756
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:21,540
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

757
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:22,979
Probably all that Spam.

758
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,912
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

759
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:29,918
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

760
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:32,188
Still crushing you guys.

761
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:36,822
We've got family here, bro.

762
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:38,490
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

763
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,728
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

764
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,533
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

765
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,034
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

766
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,869
Hey, look, man, listen.

767
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:53,376
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

768
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:57,913
<i>Kampai.</i>

769
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:00,750
See you at the gym, Donnie.

770
00:55:02,117 --> 00:55:03,518
Have a good night, ladies.

771
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:32,815
You a cop?

772
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,786
No. Are you?

773
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,661
Get out of the car.

774
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:56,638
Go!

775
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:17,923
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

776
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:19,660
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

777
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,762
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

778
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:29,839
Get up.

779
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:41,447
How does he know you?

780
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:43,285
Don't tell me
it's from the fucking gym.

781
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:46,853
Look, I don't know him.

782
00:56:46,855 --> 00:56:47,857
Smoke this punk.

783
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:54,660
Talk, motherfucker.

784
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,829
I'm not no cop, all right?

785
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,731
Now he came to me.
He know you.

786
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:01,700
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

787
00:57:01,702 --> 00:57:03,302
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

788
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:04,873
I thought he'd leave us alone.

789
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:14,515
So how much do they know?

790
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,353
Nothing.

791
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:20,353
I ain't tell them shit.

792
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,889
I don't know nothing anyway.

793
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:25,728
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

794
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:29,899
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

795
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:32,735
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

796
00:57:56,358 --> 00:57:59,428
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

797
00:58:26,922 --> 00:58:28,954
So good.

798
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:31,793
It's true, though. It's true.

799
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:33,829
Okay.

800
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:35,563
Okay.

801
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:46,840
How you doing, Nick?

802
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:48,077
Hmm.

803
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:51,978
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

804
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,150
- How are you?
- Good.

805
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:00,286
What's for...

806
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,789
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

807
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:03,993
Hmm?

808
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,763
Relax.

809
00:59:09,662 --> 00:59:11,632
I already ate.

810
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,340
Give me a pen, stud.

811
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,509
Nick, I was gonna call you.

812
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:24,043
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

813
00:59:24,045 --> 00:59:26,048
Just give me a fucking pen.

814
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:45,400
Thanks, Rudd.

815
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,405
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

816
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,813
How's the wine?

817
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:02,683
Good?

818
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,555
That's pretty fucking good.

819
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:12,057
So I imagine
I just, uh...

820
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:15,898
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

821
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:18,197
Okay.

822
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:21,768
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

823
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:25,703
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

824
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,575
or, you know,
even look at them,

825
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:32,244
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

826
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:33,746
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

827
01:00:33,748 --> 01:00:36,582
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

828
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:37,905
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

829
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,393
Can you please go, Nick?

830
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:48,562
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

831
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,601
Come on.

832
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:58,604
Come here. Give me a hug.

833
01:00:58,606 --> 01:01:01,110
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

834
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:05,280
Hmm?

835
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,916
Come on. Give me a hug.

836
01:01:10,085 --> 01:01:12,751
There you go, huh, hoss?

837
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,654
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

838
01:01:15,656 --> 01:01:17,456
There you go.

839
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,927
Yeah, pretty much.

840
01:01:20,128 --> 01:01:22,663
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

841
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:25,166
Come on, Nick, let's go.

842
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,802
Call the fucking cops.
That's what I'm saying.

843
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:33,306
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

844
01:01:33,308 --> 01:01:34,640
Call the cops.

845
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:37,275
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

846
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,911
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

847
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,950
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

848
01:01:56,163 --> 01:01:57,866
Take your time.

849
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,709
What happened to you?

850
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:17,819
Borracho, what do you think?

851
01:02:18,887 --> 01:02:20,853
What the fuck was that?

852
01:02:20,855 --> 01:02:22,155
You spotted me at the gym?

853
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:23,792
<i>Tranquillo.</i> All right?

854
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:27,862
Sit down.

855
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:33,199
I'll take it, Freddy.

856
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:35,471
Just give us a minute, okay?

857
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:41,541
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

858
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,678
When's this happening?

859
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:46,382
Friday.

860
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,148
Where?

861
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,353
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

862
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:53,719
TGIF, huh?

863
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:55,490
You're protecting me on this.

864
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,326
<i>Fräulein,</i>

865
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:00,195
we got your back, bro.

866
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,032
Don't worry about a thing.

867
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:06,769
Fuck.

868
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:11,039
Better wear your vest.

869
01:03:11,905 --> 01:03:13,208
We're in.

870
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:35,728
Z?

871
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,430
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

872
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:40,198
<i>Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.</i>

873
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,534
Tell the crew.

874
01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:48,708
I did what you told me to.

875
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:47,796
There you go.
Good job there.

876
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,569
McKenna!

877
01:11:04,212 --> 01:11:07,913
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

878
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:10,983
How are you? Good?

879
01:11:10,985 --> 01:11:12,154
What are you doing?

880
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:16,020
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

881
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:19,725
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

882
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,593
Is that okay?

883
01:11:21,595 --> 01:11:23,761
How's everything
at school? Okay?

884
01:11:23,763 --> 01:11:25,598
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

885
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,435
And what about Auntie's house?

886
01:11:29,437 --> 01:11:31,239
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

887
01:11:37,844 --> 01:11:39,744
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

888
01:11:39,746 --> 01:11:41,916
Yeah? You miss me?

889
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:50,021
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

890
01:11:50,023 --> 01:11:52,024
When am I going
to see you again?

891
01:11:52,026 --> 01:11:55,696
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

892
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:59,367
I want to come home.

893
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:03,571
Me, too.

894
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:07,809
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

895
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,212
But I'm gonna see you later.

896
01:12:11,111 --> 01:12:12,246
Promise?

897
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:16,584
I promise.

898
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:20,487
Come on.

899
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:27,128
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

900
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:29,931
Go on, Pookie.

901
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:31,997
Bye, Daddy.

902
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,335
Come on, McKenna.

903
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,137
Come on, honey.

904
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:53,815
Jock up.

905
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,191
Tac up, brother.

906
01:14:06,393 --> 01:14:08,426
No Fed?

907
01:14:08,428 --> 01:14:10,097
Change of plans.

908
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:13,832
Pay attention.

909
01:14:13,834 --> 01:14:16,874
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

910
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:20,571
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

911
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:22,410
One for semi,
two for full auto.

912
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:43,127
Mag release.

913
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:45,229
Out with the old,
in with the new.

914
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,466
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

915
01:14:47,468 --> 01:14:50,068
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

916
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:53,137
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

917
01:14:53,139 --> 01:14:54,476
- You understand?
- Got it.

918
01:14:56,209 --> 01:14:57,212
Go put your shit on.

919
01:15:18,898 --> 01:15:21,302
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

920
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:54,668
- We good?
- We good.

921
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,904
Suspects arriving on location.

922
01:16:32,906 --> 01:16:35,172
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

923
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,309
<i>They clear the bank,
we take them down.</i>

924
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:38,913
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Roger that.

925
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,355
Broad fucking daylight.

926
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,558
They're packing big.

927
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:58,531
Ooh, shit. Look at these
motherfuckers.

928
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:05,904
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

929
01:17:05,906 --> 01:17:08,372
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

930
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:09,440
Freeze!

931
01:17:09,442 --> 01:17:11,042
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

932
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:12,079
Freeze!

933
01:17:12,946 --> 01:17:14,279
Freeze!

934
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:16,213
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

935
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,085
Hurry up!

936
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:21,787
Get out here, now!

937
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:25,093
Move there now! Go! Go! Go!

938
01:17:26,259 --> 01:17:29,062
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

939
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:32,066
Eyes to the floor!

940
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,734
Listen up!

941
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:38,869
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

942
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,305
Eyes to the ground!

943
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:42,540
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

944
01:17:42,542 --> 01:17:45,711
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

945
01:17:45,713 --> 01:17:49,780
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

946
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:51,882
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

947
01:17:51,884 --> 01:17:53,154
Move down!

948
01:17:53,887 --> 01:17:55,420
Move down! Let's go!

949
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:58,289
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

950
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:01,094
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

951
01:18:01,895 --> 01:18:03,996
On my command,

952
01:18:03,998 --> 01:18:08,100
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

953
01:18:08,102 --> 01:18:10,836
and put your hands in the air.

954
01:18:10,838 --> 01:18:13,340
Everybody take
two steps forward.

955
01:18:15,075 --> 01:18:17,011
Now go down on your knees.

956
01:18:19,913 --> 01:18:21,848
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

957
01:18:22,249 --> 01:18:23,414
On me.

958
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,648
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

959
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,852
Tie them up.

960
01:18:28,422 --> 01:18:30,488
Go! Go! Go!

961
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,657
There will be
no heroics today.

962
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:35,193
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

963
01:18:35,195 --> 01:18:37,128
We're going to
be here for a while.

964
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,299
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

965
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:42,003
Take a piss on yourself.

966
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:51,511
Hey.

967
01:18:58,017 --> 01:19:00,519
You. Get up.

968
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:02,857
Stop.

969
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:08,463
Sit down.

970
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:15,532
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

971
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:18,005
Hey! Look at me.

972
01:19:19,373 --> 01:19:20,375
Take a deep breath.

973
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:25,077
Good.

974
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:27,712
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

975
01:19:27,714 --> 01:19:29,580
So I need you
to pick up the phone,

976
01:19:29,582 --> 01:19:33,550
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

977
01:19:33,552 --> 01:19:35,222
Go ahead and write this down.

978
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:41,493
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

979
01:19:41,495 --> 01:19:44,261
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

980
01:19:44,263 --> 01:19:47,564
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

981
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:50,600
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

982
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:55,172
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

983
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:57,374
No cops are to
approach the bank.

984
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:00,577
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

985
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:02,749
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

986
01:20:04,117 --> 01:20:06,586
Is that clear?
You got it all?

987
01:20:09,689 --> 01:20:11,192
Go ahead
and pick up the phone.

988
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:19,197
<i>Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...</i>

989
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,531
Shit.

990
01:20:20,533 --> 01:20:21,698
<i>...at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello</i>

991
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,103
<i>at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.</i>

992
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:26,703
- <i>Suspects are armed...</i>
- What the fuck?

993
01:20:26,705 --> 01:20:28,774
<i>...and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.</i>

994
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:31,243
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

995
01:20:31,245 --> 01:20:34,644
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

996
01:20:34,646 --> 01:20:36,213
and to back the fuck off.

997
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:39,484
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

998
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:42,921
I repeat,
have all units stand down.

999
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:44,823
It's bullshit. I can
hear them already.

1000
01:20:46,093 --> 01:20:47,613
What the fuck are they doing?

1001
01:20:53,066 --> 01:20:54,265
Stop!

1002
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:55,568
Get out!

1003
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,483
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

1004
01:21:11,084 --> 01:21:12,417
Asshole!

1005
01:21:12,419 --> 01:21:14,286
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

1006
01:21:14,288 --> 01:21:16,253
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

1007
01:21:16,255 --> 01:21:19,323
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

1008
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:20,657
That's what surveillance is!

1009
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:23,328
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

1010
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:24,664
Go. Go to the vault.

1011
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:26,632
Open it.

1012
01:21:41,513 --> 01:21:42,983
Let's go. Come.

1013
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,654
Sit. Sit down.

1014
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:57,694
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

1015
01:21:57,696 --> 01:21:59,197
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

1016
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,500
You understand?

1017
01:22:04,237 --> 01:22:05,502
Hello?

1018
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,872
<i>Hello, this is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

1019
01:22:07,874 --> 01:22:09,639
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

1020
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:11,042
This is the branch manager.

1021
01:22:11,044 --> 01:22:13,043
<i>Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.</i>

1022
01:22:13,045 --> 01:22:14,979
You are.

1023
01:22:14,981 --> 01:22:18,182
<i>Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...</i>

1024
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:23,221
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

1025
01:22:23,223 --> 01:22:24,355
<i>Who am I talking with now?</i>

1026
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:25,890
Answer the question.

1027
01:22:25,892 --> 01:22:27,590
It's being worked on
as we speak.

1028
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:28,827
<i>But you need to understand...</i>

1029
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:30,063
You just killed a hostage.

1030
01:22:31,397 --> 01:22:32,900
God damn it!

1031
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:42,373
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

1032
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,074
Come on, move!

1033
01:22:44,076 --> 01:22:46,444
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

1034
01:22:46,446 --> 01:22:50,918
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

1035
01:22:55,254 --> 01:22:56,387
Fuck!

1036
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:58,256
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

1037
01:22:58,258 --> 01:22:59,689
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

1038
01:22:59,691 --> 01:23:01,591
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

1039
01:23:01,593 --> 01:23:04,762
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

1040
01:23:04,764 --> 01:23:06,264
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

1041
01:23:06,266 --> 01:23:07,431
Yeah, fuck you!

1042
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:09,400
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

1043
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,868
Who are you
fucking pushing now?

1044
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,237
Are you fucking kidding?

1045
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,372
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You fucking pussy.

1046
01:23:14,374 --> 01:23:16,106
Fucking Lobbin' Bob is angry!

1047
01:23:16,108 --> 01:23:18,443
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

1048
01:23:18,445 --> 01:23:20,544
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

1049
01:23:20,546 --> 01:23:22,113
We've got a situation
going on...

1050
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:23,150
Shit!

1051
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:27,121
What the fuck are you
doing, Merrimen?

1052
01:23:38,298 --> 01:23:39,764
Yeah?

1053
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:42,266
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

1054
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:43,969
My name's Danny,

1055
01:23:43,971 --> 01:23:46,304
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

1056
01:23:46,306 --> 01:23:48,305
<i>Is this the person in charge?</i>

1057
01:23:48,307 --> 01:23:50,074
This is the branch manager.

1058
01:23:50,076 --> 01:23:53,644
I'm speaking on the
man in charge's behalf.

1059
01:23:53,646 --> 01:23:55,645
<i>Do you have a name,
branch manager?</i>

1060
01:23:57,316 --> 01:24:00,787
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

1061
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:03,988
They will not
speak to you again.

1062
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:07,492
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

1063
01:24:07,494 --> 01:24:09,493
Just send what they want.

1064
01:24:09,495 --> 01:24:11,462
<i>The money and the chopper
are en route,</i>

1065
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,131
<i>but it's going to take
a little bit of time.</i>

1066
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:16,370
<i>You need to give me at least
90 minutes. Is this doable?</i>

1067
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,640
Okay. Don't call back.

1068
01:24:45,898 --> 01:24:47,164
What's the prefix here?

1069
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,501
562. It's Long Beach.

1070
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,207
Hello?

1071
01:24:57,209 --> 01:24:58,411
You watching?

1072
01:25:03,049 --> 01:25:04,050
Yup.

1073
01:25:09,222 --> 01:25:11,303
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

1074
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,361
Not sure yet.

1075
01:25:18,498 --> 01:25:20,700
Did you get my number
from her cell?

1076
01:25:27,507 --> 01:25:29,110
I ain't cuffing up.

1077
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,347
That's okay.

1078
01:25:34,748 --> 01:25:37,284
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

1079
01:25:39,018 --> 01:25:40,754
Yeah, I can see that.

1080
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:02,641
Was that who I think it was?

1081
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:04,477
Yup.

1082
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:13,150
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

1083
01:26:13,152 --> 01:26:14,913
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

1084
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:27,167
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

1085
01:26:28,802 --> 01:26:29,804
Breaching!

1086
01:26:36,843 --> 01:26:38,479
Well, they just
blew the vault.

1087
01:26:39,146 --> 01:26:40,513
What the fuck?

1088
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,323
<i>Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.</i>

1089
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:54,158
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

1090
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,828
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

1091
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:58,796
<i>How's Wednesday at 2:00?</i>

1092
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,166
<i>That works. You're confirmed
for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.</i>

1093
01:27:01,168 --> 01:27:03,368
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

1094
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:04,939
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

1095
01:27:06,173 --> 01:27:07,540
So what is this?

1096
01:27:08,508 --> 01:27:10,041
This is the sewer line,

1097
01:27:10,043 --> 01:27:12,813
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

1098
01:27:33,032 --> 01:27:34,392
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

1099
01:27:35,201 --> 01:27:37,368
We're waiting on clearance.

1100
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,369
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

1101
01:27:39,371 --> 01:27:42,706
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

1102
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,145
O'Brien, hey!

1103
01:27:45,543 --> 01:27:48,212
Is he off his meds?

1104
01:27:48,214 --> 01:27:50,215
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

1105
01:27:50,217 --> 01:27:51,716
Will you shut the fuck up?

1106
01:27:51,718 --> 01:27:52,887
Oh, fuck you.

1107
01:28:03,062 --> 01:28:05,595
We better go back him up.

1108
01:28:05,597 --> 01:28:07,164
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

1109
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,169
Here we go.

1110
01:28:13,839 --> 01:28:15,842
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

1111
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:40,430
Everybody okay?

1112
01:28:40,432 --> 01:28:41,768
Yes.

1113
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:52,143
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

1114
01:29:07,294 --> 01:29:08,494
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

1115
01:29:09,795 --> 01:29:10,962
Nick!

1116
01:29:10,964 --> 01:29:11,999
Clear!

1117
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,635
Clear!

1118
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,480
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

1119
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:31,650
<i>What's your location?</i>

1120
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,327
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

1121
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:44,862
I forgot to schedule a drop
at the Pico Rivera Savings.

1122
01:29:44,864 --> 01:29:46,500
What do you have open today?

1123
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,540
<i>Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?</i>

1124
01:29:56,542 --> 01:30:00,013
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

1125
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:15,161
Pico Rivera.

1126
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:25,702
Horsepower all set?

1127
01:30:25,704 --> 01:30:27,207
<i>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</i>

1128
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,054
They got you
on a new route?

1129
01:30:43,056 --> 01:30:45,922
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

1130
01:30:45,924 --> 01:30:49,658
All right. Let me
get you guys' IDs, man.

1131
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:52,398
Yeah, sure. There you go.

1132
01:31:00,005 --> 01:31:01,407
All right.

1133
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:03,740
You're good to go.

1134
01:31:03,742 --> 01:31:05,982
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

1135
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,422
Oh, fuck.

1136
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:00,965
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

1137
01:32:00,967 --> 01:32:02,466
Yup, that's us.

1138
01:32:02,468 --> 01:32:03,835
Bring her up.

1139
01:32:03,837 --> 01:32:05,806
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

1140
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,114
- Sign here.
- You got it.

1141
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,785
You're new here, Mark?

1142
01:32:18,817 --> 01:32:20,020
Yes, sir.

1143
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:23,687
You guys running
a little bit late.

1144
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:26,794
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

1145
01:32:28,495 --> 01:32:30,127
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

1146
01:32:30,129 --> 01:32:32,430
but we run a tight, tight ship
around here,

1147
01:32:32,432 --> 01:32:34,832
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

1148
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:36,300
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

1149
01:32:36,302 --> 01:32:38,671
Just have them call.

1150
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:40,808
On me.

1151
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,380
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

1152
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:23,548
Copy that.

1153
01:33:24,049 --> 01:33:25,351
New guys.

1154
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:28,187
I'm going to
step out for a minute.

1155
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:56,913
How you guys doing today?

1156
01:33:56,915 --> 01:33:58,718
- Good. All right.
- Good.

1157
01:34:04,623 --> 01:34:05,789
How you doing?

1158
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,426
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

1159
01:34:08,428 --> 01:34:09,963
Sign that for me, please.

1160
01:34:12,597 --> 01:34:14,598
All hundreds?

1161
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,404
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

1162
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:19,869
We're a little backed up.

1163
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:21,439
All right, do what you can.

1164
01:34:21,441 --> 01:34:23,706
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

1165
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:24,709
Thank you.

1166
01:34:35,254 --> 01:34:37,586
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

1167
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:39,289
Can you get that to us?

1168
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:41,261
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

1169
01:34:41,995 --> 01:34:43,127
Desperately.

1170
01:34:43,129 --> 01:34:45,799
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

1171
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:15,993
Silverback, this
is Horsepower. I'm in.

1172
01:35:15,995 --> 01:35:19,531
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

1173
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:23,668
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

1174
01:35:31,843 --> 01:35:33,379
Okay, here we go.

1175
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,849
Johnny, we're fucking brown
again, man.

1176
01:35:38,851 --> 01:35:40,954
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

1177
01:35:42,054 --> 01:35:44,520
We're going brown.

1178
01:35:44,522 --> 01:35:47,083
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

1179
01:35:57,136 --> 01:35:58,202
Luigi, come on.

1180
01:35:58,204 --> 01:36:00,573
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1181
01:36:13,352 --> 01:36:15,222
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

1182
01:36:17,423 --> 01:36:19,224
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

1183
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,032
Get ready to go.

1184
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:40,211
<i>Powering up EMP now.</i>

1185
01:36:46,517 --> 01:36:47,752
All clear here.

1186
01:36:47,754 --> 01:36:48,755
Good to go.

1187
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:53,125
You're clear. Go.

1188
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,867
Shit. Check something out.

1189
01:37:02,869 --> 01:37:04,435
What do you think it is?

1190
01:37:04,437 --> 01:37:06,106
Are the cameras up
in the 100 room?

1191
01:37:06,873 --> 01:37:08,606
Uh, negative.

1192
01:37:14,147 --> 01:37:16,313
555-0143.

1193
01:37:16,315 --> 01:37:17,451
It's taking too long.

1194
01:37:18,483 --> 01:37:19,783
Tasty Orders.

1195
01:37:19,785 --> 01:37:21,118
<i>This is Sharon at the Fed.</i>

1196
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,386
<i>Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.</i>

1197
01:37:23,388 --> 01:37:25,256
<i>Now, I only have so much time
on my lunch break.</i>

1198
01:37:25,258 --> 01:37:27,457
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

1199
01:37:27,459 --> 01:37:29,059
They just called
for the Chinese.

1200
01:37:29,061 --> 01:37:30,163
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

1201
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:35,332
Motion is out in there, too.

1202
01:37:35,334 --> 01:37:36,635
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

1203
01:37:38,737 --> 01:37:41,305
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

1204
01:37:41,307 --> 01:37:42,309
All right.

1205
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:45,775
Done.

1206
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,347
Okay. Better get
that count, too.

1207
01:37:59,258 --> 01:38:01,826
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

1208
01:38:01,828 --> 01:38:04,498
Hey, man, we got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

1209
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:13,670
Luigi...

1210
01:38:13,672 --> 01:38:15,175
Step on it.
Step on it, quick.

1211
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:18,608
Yeah?

1212
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:20,043
- Luigi.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1213
01:38:20,045 --> 01:38:23,314
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

1214
01:38:23,316 --> 01:38:24,981
Say again? Russell?

1215
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,653
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

1216
01:38:30,521 --> 01:38:32,324
What the hell is
going on here today?

1217
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:37,194
<i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i>

1218
01:38:37,196 --> 01:38:38,694
<i>He's</i> hot-micing
<i>like a motherfucker.</i>

1219
01:38:38,696 --> 01:38:41,231
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

1220
01:38:41,233 --> 01:38:43,203
<i>All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.</i>

1221
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:53,145
You're clear. Go.

1222
01:39:01,387 --> 01:39:02,389
Holy shit.

1223
01:39:39,959 --> 01:39:41,759
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

1224
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:43,693
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

1225
01:39:43,695 --> 01:39:45,694
Dude, it's not me.

1226
01:39:45,696 --> 01:39:48,265
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

1227
01:39:48,267 --> 01:39:49,934
<i>Switch to line five.</i>

1228
01:39:49,936 --> 01:39:52,177
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

1229
01:40:20,632 --> 01:40:21,735
They're back. Get out.

1230
01:41:01,206 --> 01:41:03,273
Luigi, you see anything, man?

1231
01:41:03,275 --> 01:41:05,208
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

1232
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:07,144
What am I looking for?

1233
01:41:07,146 --> 01:41:08,779
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room. Run the count,

1234
01:41:08,781 --> 01:41:10,781
- <i>and make sure we're good, all right?</i>
- Copy that.

1235
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,850
Where are you?

1236
01:41:13,852 --> 01:41:15,721
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

1237
01:41:22,794 --> 01:41:24,496
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

1238
01:41:27,967 --> 01:41:30,565
We are back up, brother.

1239
01:41:30,567 --> 01:41:32,739
All teams,
back to the count room.

1240
01:41:35,206 --> 01:41:36,840
Get on with LAPD Central.

1241
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:39,976
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

1242
01:41:39,978 --> 01:41:43,046
<i>Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.</i>

1243
01:41:43,048 --> 01:41:45,049
<i>Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.</i>

1244
01:41:47,218 --> 01:41:50,020
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

1245
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:51,391
Let's just check the count.

1246
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:22,422
$712,200.

1247
01:42:24,456 --> 01:42:25,892
$712,200.

1248
01:42:26,925 --> 01:42:29,195
Russell, the count is on.

1249
01:42:30,763 --> 01:42:33,029
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

1250
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:34,433
Take Alameda out.

1251
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,421
The count was good.

1252
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,590
But both of your bins
were half-full.

1253
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:02,259
Sorry?

1254
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:04,129
Your bins,
they were half-full.

1255
01:43:05,498 --> 01:43:06,930
That's how we got them.

1256
01:43:06,932 --> 01:43:10,734
Next time, just put it
in a cash sack.

1257
01:43:10,736 --> 01:43:12,435
Makes things a lot easier.

1258
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:14,738
Try and work smart, not hard.

1259
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,340
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

1260
01:45:04,282 --> 01:45:08,085
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

1261
01:45:08,087 --> 01:45:10,327
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

1262
01:45:36,614 --> 01:45:38,985
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

1263
01:45:40,886 --> 01:45:42,155
- All right.
- There you go.

1264
01:45:58,569 --> 01:46:00,139
Chinese food guy?

1265
01:46:00,839 --> 01:46:02,408
Go on. Buzz him in.

1266
01:46:07,812 --> 01:46:08,947
Hold him there.

1267
01:46:12,151 --> 01:46:13,286
2-4-5.

1268
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,460
Yeah, send him through.

1269
01:46:24,263 --> 01:46:26,766
Come here for a sec, buddy.

1270
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,337
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

1271
01:46:35,273 --> 01:46:37,106
Where's your name?

1272
01:46:37,108 --> 01:46:40,176
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

1273
01:46:40,178 --> 01:46:41,446
I don't know what to tell you.

1274
01:46:45,217 --> 01:46:46,315
Mmm-mmm.

1275
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,021
Damn you finicky.

1276
01:46:49,154 --> 01:46:50,618
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1277
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:52,688
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1278
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:53,692
That's all I need.

1279
01:46:59,063 --> 01:47:01,030
All right, you boys
are good to go.

1280
01:47:01,032 --> 01:47:02,564
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

1281
01:47:02,566 --> 01:47:04,070
- You have a good day.
- All right.

1282
01:47:10,742 --> 01:47:13,045
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

1283
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:18,483
Yes, security in
the lobby, please.

1284
01:47:27,759 --> 01:47:28,891
Lobby.

1285
01:47:28,893 --> 01:47:30,894
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

1286
01:47:30,896 --> 01:47:33,266
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

1287
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:36,769
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

1288
01:47:41,173 --> 01:47:44,077
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

1289
01:47:45,076 --> 01:47:46,544
Copy that.

1290
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:01,091
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

1291
01:48:01,093 --> 01:48:03,960
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

1292
01:48:03,962 --> 01:48:06,595
<i>Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.</i>

1293
01:48:06,597 --> 01:48:07,632
Copy that.

1294
01:48:28,887 --> 01:48:30,787
Move! Let's go! Get out!

1295
01:48:30,789 --> 01:48:33,256
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

1296
01:48:33,258 --> 01:48:35,470
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

1297
01:48:35,494 --> 01:48:36,829
Be cool, bro. Cool.

1298
01:48:38,562 --> 01:48:39,965
Fuck.

1299
01:48:59,351 --> 01:49:01,117
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

1300
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,918
Eyes on suspect.

1301
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:07,023
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

1302
01:49:07,025 --> 01:49:09,458
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

1303
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,094
Let's get this motherfucker.

1304
01:49:11,096 --> 01:49:12,816
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

1305
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,969
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

1306
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:21,040
Fuck.

1307
01:49:21,507 --> 01:49:22,606
Hit him!

1308
01:49:31,548 --> 01:49:33,618
Motherfucker.

1309
01:49:50,302 --> 01:49:52,982
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

1310
01:49:57,843 --> 01:49:59,809
Little fuck.

1311
01:49:59,811 --> 01:50:02,248
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

1312
01:50:03,214 --> 01:50:04,217
Fuck.

1313
01:50:06,884 --> 01:50:08,753
<i>Fucking... Fucker!</i>

1314
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:13,557
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

1315
01:50:17,829 --> 01:50:19,996
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

1316
01:50:19,998 --> 01:50:22,534
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

1317
01:50:31,843 --> 01:50:33,709
Silverback, go.

1318
01:50:33,712 --> 01:50:35,248
<i>Horsepower's burned.</i>

1319
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:38,715
Repeat that. I can't hear you.

1320
01:50:38,717 --> 01:50:40,917
Horsepower is burned.

1321
01:50:40,919 --> 01:50:42,554
<i>He's done.</i>

1322
01:50:43,922 --> 01:50:45,724
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

1323
01:51:05,309 --> 01:51:07,210
Fuck!

1324
01:51:07,212 --> 01:51:09,145
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

1325
01:51:09,147 --> 01:51:10,779
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

1326
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:11,784
It's good.

1327
01:51:13,884 --> 01:51:17,820
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

1328
01:51:17,822 --> 01:51:19,392
10-4. Headed to you.

1329
01:51:26,231 --> 01:51:27,711
What happened
to the other two?

1330
01:51:31,668 --> 01:51:33,306
They got burned.

1331
01:51:58,964 --> 01:52:00,329
Eyes on suspects.

1332
01:52:00,331 --> 01:52:02,034
Black, four-door Suburban!

1333
01:52:07,806 --> 01:52:09,673
Heading southbound on Alameda.

1334
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:16,448
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

1335
01:52:26,057 --> 01:52:27,892
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

1336
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,462
Corridor's backed up.

1337
01:52:37,369 --> 01:52:40,170
We just turned down Alameda Corridor,
heading south.

1338
01:52:49,481 --> 01:52:50,582
Shit.

1339
01:52:59,656 --> 01:53:01,657
Coming up on suspect,
six o'clock.

1340
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:03,059
Shit.

1341
01:53:03,061 --> 01:53:05,228
Right lane is closed up ahead.

1342
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:08,366
<i>I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.</i>

1343
01:53:13,205 --> 01:53:15,505
You guys see that?

1344
01:53:15,507 --> 01:53:17,575
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

1345
01:53:21,579 --> 01:53:22,848
Is that...

1346
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,754
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

1347
01:53:31,923 --> 01:53:33,591
Fuck backup.
We've got to move now.

1348
01:53:34,459 --> 01:53:35,761
Fuck.

1349
01:53:43,134 --> 01:53:44,235
Yup.

1350
01:53:50,275 --> 01:53:51,607
That's them.

1351
01:53:57,315 --> 01:53:59,547
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

1352
01:53:59,549 --> 01:54:01,120
Yeah, here we go.

1353
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:07,289
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

1354
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:08,625
Cuff him up.

1355
01:54:18,569 --> 01:54:21,136
Be advised, suspects wearing
body armor.

1356
01:54:21,138 --> 01:54:23,939
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

1357
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:25,181
Copy that.
Go around right here.

1358
01:54:29,915 --> 01:54:31,417
It's jammed up.

1359
01:54:38,521 --> 01:54:40,524
Good? Okay, let's go.

1360
01:54:51,436 --> 01:54:53,336
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1361
01:54:53,338 --> 01:54:54,538
They're getting
out of the car.

1362
01:55:00,378 --> 01:55:02,011
Z, go down the right.

1363
01:55:02,013 --> 01:55:05,014
Gus, Borracho, center with me.

1364
01:55:05,016 --> 01:55:07,619
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

1365
01:55:08,519 --> 01:55:10,121
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

1366
01:55:12,522 --> 01:55:14,125
Let's go.

1367
01:55:15,026 --> 01:55:16,195
Stay down. Stay down.

1368
01:55:43,587 --> 01:55:44,924
Get down. Get down.

1369
01:55:49,193 --> 01:55:51,393
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

1370
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:01,005
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

1371
01:56:04,174 --> 01:56:06,344
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

1372
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,217
Get down behind the wheel.

1373
01:56:18,757 --> 01:56:20,437
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

1374
01:56:26,298 --> 01:56:27,398
Oh, shit.

1375
01:56:30,101 --> 01:56:31,370
Borracho!

1376
01:56:37,776 --> 01:56:38,811
Moving!

1377
01:56:41,446 --> 01:56:42,448
Moving.

1378
01:57:01,465 --> 01:57:05,301
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

1379
01:57:05,303 --> 01:57:07,740
Tony Z, you ready?

1380
01:57:08,473 --> 01:57:09,808
Let's go.

1381
01:57:32,596 --> 01:57:33,631
Moving!

1382
01:57:38,503 --> 01:57:39,505
Move!

1383
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:46,946
Moving. Moving.

1384
01:57:52,017 --> 01:57:53,385
Mag change!

1385
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:00,992
Moving.

1386
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:07,066
Mag change.

1387
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:20,411
Moving!

1388
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:26,884
Go! Go! Peel off!

1389
01:58:37,227 --> 01:58:38,360
Tony, you okay?

1390
01:58:38,362 --> 01:58:40,065
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

1391
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,034
Fuck!

1392
01:58:47,071 --> 01:58:48,072
Go!

1393
01:58:56,047 --> 01:58:57,049
Cover!

1394
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,122
Move.

1395
01:59:13,231 --> 01:59:14,400
Fuck!

1396
01:59:31,215 --> 01:59:32,647
Brick wall! Brick wall!

1397
01:59:32,649 --> 01:59:34,119
Behind the brick building!

1398
02:01:21,892 --> 02:01:23,326
My kids...

1399
02:01:24,829 --> 02:01:26,331
You're in His hands now.

1400
02:01:27,432 --> 02:01:28,733
You hear me?

1401
02:02:18,316 --> 02:02:19,318
Fuck!

1402
02:04:01,551 --> 02:04:02,754
Don't do it.

1403
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:31,413
Told you.

1404
02:04:46,596 --> 02:04:48,531
Yeah. You did.

1405
02:05:51,795 --> 02:05:53,197
What the fuck?

1406
02:06:04,508 --> 02:06:05,708
You see this?

1407
02:06:06,843 --> 02:06:08,179
Here. Do those.

1408
02:06:13,351 --> 02:06:14,352
Oh, shit.

1409
02:06:21,025 --> 02:06:24,362
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

1410
02:06:25,529 --> 02:06:27,365
Like 10,000 of them?

1411
02:06:36,573 --> 02:06:38,474
You check on the boys?

1412
02:06:38,476 --> 02:06:40,544
Yeah, I'm going
to roll to the hospital.

1413
02:06:45,215 --> 02:06:47,486
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

1414
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,262
Yeah.

1415
02:07:00,431 --> 02:07:01,900
All right.

1416
02:07:04,035 --> 02:07:05,569
This won't go to Harbor.

1417
02:07:24,521 --> 02:07:26,291
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

1418
02:07:28,258 --> 02:07:29,457
Thanks.

1419
02:07:29,459 --> 02:07:30,926
You all right?

1420
02:07:30,928 --> 02:07:32,364
Yeah, I'm okay.

1421
02:07:33,763 --> 02:07:35,130
Yeah.

1422
02:07:35,132 --> 02:07:38,303
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

1423
02:07:39,102 --> 02:07:40,105
Here.

1424
02:07:41,938 --> 02:07:43,307
It's organic.

1425
02:07:51,781 --> 02:07:54,418
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

1426
02:07:56,821 --> 02:07:58,156
Apparently so.

1427
02:09:28,745 --> 02:09:30,214
Hey, is Donnie around?

1428
02:09:32,148 --> 02:09:33,218
He quit.

1429
02:09:35,719 --> 02:09:37,321
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

1430
02:09:38,655 --> 02:09:40,225
I said he quit.

1431
02:09:41,057 --> 02:09:42,259
Two days ago.

1432
02:09:57,907 --> 02:09:59,244
You want a beer?

1433
02:10:00,009 --> 02:10:02,911
Very much so. Like 50.

1434
02:10:09,253 --> 02:10:10,955
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1435
02:10:25,702 --> 02:10:28,369
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

1436
02:10:28,371 --> 02:10:31,142
The new girl who
works down the hall?

1437
02:10:32,276 --> 02:10:34,709
What's going on, gentlemen?

1438
02:10:34,712 --> 02:10:36,712
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

1439
02:10:36,714 --> 02:10:40,885
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

1440
02:10:56,299 --> 02:10:57,665
How did you get that job?

1441
02:10:57,667 --> 02:10:58,969
Can you actually count?

1442
02:11:00,637 --> 02:11:02,805
<i>I'm in complete
control of my environment.</i>

1443
02:11:02,807 --> 02:11:03,907
People don't even know.

1444
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:34,605
Fucking <i>Fräulein.</i>

1445
02:11:44,181 --> 02:11:46,215
What's going on, boys?

1446
02:11:46,217 --> 02:11:47,551
How you doing? You good?

1447
02:11:48,517 --> 02:11:49,685
Some beers?

1448
02:11:50,187 --> 02:11:51,720
Hey, guv.

1449
02:11:51,722 --> 02:11:53,324
A round of beers for my mates.

1450
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:56,024
And for you?

1451
02:11:56,026 --> 02:11:57,028
I'm easy.

1452
02:12:02,031 --> 02:12:03,200
I don't know.

1453
02:12:03,733 --> 02:12:04,736
Surprise me.

1454
02:12:07,871 --> 02:12:09,307
I can do that.

1455
02:12:10,539 --> 02:12:12,209
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1456
02:12:13,209 --> 02:12:14,743
So why you come to me?

1457
02:12:14,745 --> 02:12:16,411
You're a beast, man.

1458
02:12:16,413 --> 02:12:17,979
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

1459
02:12:17,981 --> 02:12:19,914
Listen.

1460
02:12:19,916 --> 02:12:21,884
We do this, I call the shots.

1461
02:12:21,886 --> 02:12:23,587
My crew, my job, not yours.

1462
02:12:24,587 --> 02:12:26,387
Got it?

1463
02:12:26,389 --> 02:12:28,549
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

1464
02:12:29,727 --> 02:12:31,059
That's it.

1465
02:12:31,061 --> 02:12:32,660
It's my baby.

1466
02:12:32,662 --> 02:12:33,897
That's what I've got.

1467
02:12:35,565 --> 02:12:37,399
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

1468
02:12:37,401 --> 02:12:39,768
You got this all at that bar?

1469
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:41,272
Collected it over time.

1470
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:44,775
Wow.

1471
02:12:54,683 --> 02:12:55,786
Job for Superman.

1472
02:13:09,133 --> 02:13:11,233
Cheers.

1473
02:13:11,235 --> 02:13:13,435
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

1474
02:13:14,772 --> 02:13:16,140
You work across the street?

1475
02:13:16,807 --> 02:13:17,809
Yeah.

1476
02:13:18,474 --> 02:13:20,108
Diamond exchange?

1477
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:21,112
That's right.

1478
02:13:24,949 --> 02:13:26,217
Beer's on me.
